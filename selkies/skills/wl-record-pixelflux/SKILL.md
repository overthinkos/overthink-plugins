# wl-record-pixelflux -- Desktop video recording via selkies capture bridge

## Candy Properties

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| Install files | `charly.yml`, `task:`, `pixelflux-record` (Python script) |
| Depends | `selkies` (capture bridge + WebSocket stream), `ffmpeg` (MP4 muxing) |

## What It Does

Provides `pixelflux-record` for recording desktop video on selkies-desktop. Connects to the capture bridge at `/tmp/charly-capture.sock` which relays the same H.264 frames that the browser sees via the selkies WebSocket stream. No direct ScreenCapture API access -- taps into the existing selkies streaming pipeline to avoid creating a second capture instance (the Rust backend only supports one active capture at a time).

**Why not wf-recorder?** labwc running nested inside pixelflux can't deliver wlr-screencopy frames. The capture bridge bypasses this by tapping into the selkies WebSocket stream directly.

## How It Works

1. Connects to Unix socket at `/tmp/charly-capture.sock` (started by `selkies-capture-server`)
2. Sends `STREAM\n` to request continuous H.264 frame data
3. Receives frames as `4-byte length + raw H.264 data` pairs
4. Pipes raw H.264 data to ffmpeg with `-use_wallclock_as_timestamps 1`
5. ffmpeg re-encodes to MP4 with correct wall-clock timing
6. SIGINT/SIGTERM triggers graceful shutdown: closes socket, waits for ffmpeg to finalize MP4

## Key Properties

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| Depends | `selkies` (capture bridge + stream), `ffmpeg` (muxing) |
| Install | `~/.local/bin/pixelflux-record` (Python script) |
| Capture | Via `/tmp/charly-capture.sock` (selkies WebSocket bridge) |
| Output | MP4 (H.264 video + optional AAC audio) |
| Audio | PulseAudio monitor source via ffmpeg |

## CLI Usage

```bash
# Direct usage
pixelflux-record output.mp4                  # 30fps, video only
pixelflux-record output.mp4 --fps 60         # 60fps
pixelflux-record output.mp4 --audio          # video + audio
pixelflux-record output.mp4 --fps 60 --audio # 60fps + audio
# Stop with Ctrl-C
```

## Integration with the `record:` check verb

Author `record:` plan steps (the declarative verb served out-of-process by
`candy/plugin-record` — no host `charly check` subcommand for it) and run them with
`charly check live selkies-desktop --filter record`. A `record: start` step with
`record_mode: desktop` + `record_audio: true` auto-detects pixelflux-record; desktop
interaction is driven with the `cdp:`/`wl:` verbs (which keep their host subcommands);
`record: stop` + `artifact:` copies the `.mp4` out:

```yaml
pixelflux-rec-start:
    check: a desktop recording with audio starts
    record: start
    context: [deploy]
    record_name: demo
    record_mode: desktop
    record_audio: true
pixelflux-rec-stop:
    check: the desktop recording is captured
    record: stop
    context: [deploy]
    record_name: demo
    artifact: demo.mp4
    artifact_not_uniform: true
```

## Architecture

```
selkies process (single ScreenCapture singleton — process-wide)
    ├── ScreenCapture (captures full composited desktop)
    ├── WebSocket server :8081 (broadcasts H.264 frames)
    └── Capture bridge thread (internal WebSocket client)
        └── Unix socket /tmp/charly-capture.sock
            └── pixelflux-record connects here (STREAM mode)
                └── pipes H.264 frames to ffmpeg
```

**Singleton note:** The `ScreenCapture` instance is process-wide and lives inside the selkies Python process. `pixelflux-record` never spawns its own capture; it only attaches to the existing STREAM socket. This is architecturally important because pixelflux's `WaylandBackend` construction is expensive (EGL context + dmabuf allocators + GPU texture pools) and was the subject of a memory leak fix in commits `6be85eb` (singleton enforcement) and `7977b91` (per-frame `cleanup_texture_cache()`). If you ever see two selkies-capture processes inside the container, that's a regression — see `/charly-selkies:selkies` (Pixelflux Memory Management) for the diagnostic recipe.

## Included In

- `selkies-desktop` metalayer

## Used In Boxes

- `/charly-selkies:selkies-labwc` (via `selkies-desktop` metalayer)
- `/charly-selkies:selkies-labwc-nvidia` (via `selkies-desktop` metalayer)

## Cross-References

- `/charly-check:record` -- the `record:` check verb (`record_mode: desktop`) auto-detects pixelflux-record
- `/charly-core:charly-update` -- Per-instance update pattern used to roll out the per-frame `cleanup_texture_cache()` fix across live instances
- `/charly-selkies:wl-screenshot-pixelflux` -- Screenshot companion (same capture bridge, same singleton)
- `/charly-selkies:wf-recorder` -- Alternative for sway-desktop (wlr-screencopy)
- `/charly-selkies:selkies` -- Parent candy (provides capture bridge, WebSocket stream, and the ScreenCapture singleton — see Pixelflux Memory Management)
- `/charly-selkies:selkies-desktop-layer` -- Metalayer that composes this recorder into the full browser-accessible desktop
- `/charly-selkies:ffmpeg` -- Required dependency (MP4 muxing)

## When to Use This Skill

Use when the user asks about:
- Desktop video recording on selkies-desktop
- The pixelflux recording pipeline
- The `wl-record-pixelflux` candy
