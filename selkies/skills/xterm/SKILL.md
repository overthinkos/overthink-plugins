# xterm - X11 Terminal (XWayland)

## Overview

Lightweight X11 terminal emulator. On labwc (selkies-desktop), launching xterm triggers XWayland to start on-demand, enabling X11-based automation tools (xdotool, xprop, xwininfo) to find windows.

## Candy Definition

```yaml
rpm:
  packages:
    - xterm
```

## Key Properties

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| Depends | None |
| Packages | `xterm` |
| WM_CLASS | `xterm` / `XTerm` |
| XWayland | Triggers on-demand start on labwc |

## Usage

Drive xterm through the `wl:` verb's methods (run with `charly check live <image> --filter wl`):

- `wl: exec` — launch xterm (triggers XWayland)
- `wl: focus` — focus by app_id
- `wl: xprop` — query X11 properties
- `wl: geometry` — get window position/size
- `wl: close` — close window

**Important:** The `wl: exec` verb sets `DISPLAY=:0` automatically for X11 apps.

## Why It's in selkies-desktop

labwc has XWayland compiled in (`+xwayland`) but starts it on-demand only when an X11 client opens. Without an X11 app like xterm:
- XWayland never starts
- xdotool, xprop, xwininfo find no windows
- the `wl: scroll` method (xdotool click 4/5) and the `wl: drag` method (xdotool mousedown/mouseup) can't target X11 windows

With xterm installed, users can launch it to enable full XWayland testing.
