  uv + uvx — Astral's fast Python package/project manager. Installs as a
  direct-download binary (no pixi env, no Python dep). Pulled via the
  `download:` verb with `strip_components: 1` to handle the upstream
  tarball's arch-prefixed top-level directory.
  Use when working with the uv candy or when deciding whether to install a
  CLI tool via pixi vs. direct binary download.

# uv -- Python package / project manager (astral-sh/uv)

## Candy Properties

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| Kind | Direct-download binary candy |
| Install files | `charly.yml` (no pixi.toml, no dependencies) |
| Depends | **(none)** — uv is a self-contained Rust binary |
| Binaries | `/usr/local/bin/uv`, `/usr/local/bin/uvx` |

## Why direct download (not pixi)

uv is a completely self-contained Rust binary needing no Python runtime, so
installing it via pixi (`pixi.toml` with `uv = "*"` + `require: python`,
landing it in `$HOME/.pixi/envs/default/bin/` inside a conda-forge Python
environment) would be the wrong fit. Pixi would bring three problems uv
doesn't warrant:

- Image bloat — the pixi env drags in ~500 MB of Python stdlib + numpy
  transitively, nothing of which uv actually uses.
- HOME-dependency — the binary path would vary per-image's `$HOME`, and
  HOME-relative PATH entries in child images go subtly wrong when the
  `charly` auto-intermediate machinery bakes uid=1000 paths into boxes
  deployed at uid=0 (handled in `charly/intermediates.go` — see
  `/charly-internals:generate-source` "UID-keyed sibling grouping").
- Confusion — "uv is installed but `which uv` says not found" for
  anyone who isn't in a pixi shell.

So uv installs the way `/charly-coder:typst` and `/charly-languages:pixi` itself do
— fetch the upstream binary, unpack to `/usr/local/bin`, done. System-wide
reachable, always on PATH, no HOME gymnastics.

## Install plan

```yaml
# a child step node under the uv candy entity
uv-download:
    run: download and unpack the uv binary to /usr/local/bin
    download: "https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/releases/latest/download/uv-${BUILD_ARCH}-unknown-linux-gnu.tar.gz"
    extract: tar.gz
    strip_components: 1
    to: /usr/local/bin
    run_as: root
```

`${BUILD_ARCH}` expands to `x86_64` / `aarch64` at build time. Upstream
ships per-arch tarballs under stable latest-download URLs, nested one
level deep (`uv-x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu/uv`, `…/uvx`). The
`strip_components: 1` modifier (see `/charly-image:layer` "Download verb")
collapses that wrapper so both binaries land directly at
`/usr/local/bin/uv` and `/usr/local/bin/uvx`.

## Tests

Three build-scope tests ship with the candy:

| Test | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `uv-binary` | `/usr/local/bin/uv` exists |
| `uv-version` | `uv --version` exits 0 |
| `uvx-binary` | `/usr/local/bin/uvx` exists (the per-run tool runner) |

## Used In Boxes

- `/charly-coder:fedora-coder` — the canonical kitchen-sink dev box.
- Any box composing `hermes-full` or directly including `uv`.

## Related Candies

- `/charly-languages:pixi` — direct-download pattern this candy now mirrors. Pixi remains a legitimate multi-binary Python env manager for boxes that genuinely need one (jupyter, whisper, openwebui); uv is too small to justify the overhead.
- `/charly-coder:typst` — sibling direct-download binary pattern.
- `/charly-languages:python` — the pixi-python meta-layer this candy does **not** depend on.
- `/charly-coder:rust` — system Rust toolchain, if you want to build uv from source instead (`cargo install uv`). Usually not worth it — the Astral binary is pre-optimized.

## Related Commands

- `/charly-image:layer` — authoring reference (covers `download:` verb + `strip_components:` modifier)
- `/charly-core:shell` — run `uv` inside a container

## When to Use This Skill

**MUST be invoked** when:

- Adding `uv` to a box's candy list.
- Authoring a sibling candy for a small Rust/Go CLI tool — this is the
  canonical pattern (direct download > pixi > anything else).
- Debugging why `uv --version` fails: it's a `$PATH` or binary-landing-
  at-wrong-path issue, not a Python env problem.
- Understanding why "uv has no dependencies" is correct even though it
  manages Python packages.
