# ov migrate — single-command schema migration

`ov migrate` is **one idempotent command** that brings any overthink config — however old — up to the **latest schema CalVer**, and only to the latest. There are no sub-verbs to choose between: `ov migrate` always runs the whole ordered migration chain to HEAD.

```bash
ov migrate            # migrate every reachable config to the latest schema CalVer
ov migrate --dry-run  # print every change the chain would make; touch nothing
```

The project directory is the current working directory; use the top-level `-C` / `--dir` / `OV_PROJECT_DIR` global to point elsewhere (`main()` chdir's before dispatch).

## CalVer schema versioning

The YAML schema version is a **CalVer string** — `version: YYYY.DDD.HHMM`, the same `ComputeCalVer` scheme as image tags (e.g. `version: 2026.141.1530`). It replaced the pre-2026-05 integer `version: 4`. Every versioned file carries the stamp:

- `overthink.yml` + the per-kind siblings `image.yml` / `deploy.yml` / `vm.yml` / `pod.yml` / `k8s.yml` / `local.yml` (and `eval.yml` when present)
- the per-host `~/.config/ov/deploy.yml`

`ov/version.go` provides `ParseCalVer(string) (CalVer, bool)` and `CalVer.Less` (generation-only `ComputeCalVer` is unchanged). `LatestSchemaVersion()` (in `ov/migrate_registry.go`) is the curated **HEAD** value — the constant every file is stamped to and the value the load-time gate requires.

### `version:` is also the per-repo git-tag source

The CalVer `version:` doubles as the **release git tag** for any ov-project repo (one with an `overthink.yml`): every push of such a repo carries an **immutable** annotated tag `v<version>` matching that repo's current `overthink.yml` `version:` (e.g. `version: 2026.141.1600` → tag `v2026.141.1600`). Each repo uses its OWN `version:` — the main repo and every `image/<distro>` submodule are tagged independently, even when they happen to share a value. The tag is created once, the first time a `version:` value lands on a pushed commit, and is never moved or force-pushed. A new tag appears only when `ov migrate` bumps `version:` to a new `LatestSchemaVersion()` — a push at an unchanged `version:` adds no new tag (the existing `v<version>` already marks that schema version, which is why the load-time gate never sees a "newer than supported" CalVer from a re-tag). Repos without an `overthink.yml` (`plugins`, `pkg/arch`) are out of scope. See CLAUDE.md "Post-Execution Policies".

## The migration chain (registry)

Every hard-cutover schema change the project has ever shipped is **one `MigrationStep`** in the ordered registry `migrationSteps()` (`ov/migrate_registry.go`), stamped with the CalVer of the date it landed and listed **chronologically** — the order the cutovers were authored in, which is the only correct replay order for an arbitrarily-old config. `ov migrate` runs the whole chain; each step's own idempotency guard makes running it whole safe (already-current files are no-ops).

| CalVer | Step | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| 2026.112.522 | unified | legacy `image.yml`+`build.yml`+flat `layer.yml` → `overthink.yml` (kind-keyed wrappers + `include:`); raw-INI `service:` / `system_services:` → structured `service:` list |
| 2026.114.1558 | schema-v4 | v3 → v4: flatten `deployments.images.*` → `deployment.*`, plural→singular root keys, `children:`→`nested:`, `target: container`→`pod` etc. |
| 2026.114.2207 | description | scaffold a Gherkin `description:` block from legacy `info:`/`status:` |
| 2026.123.114 | target-local | `kind: host`→`kind: local`, `host.yml`→`local.yml`, `target: host`→`target: local` |
| 2026.123.1351 | calamares | layer.yml: `depends:`→`requires:`, collapse `rpm:`/`deb:`/`pac:`/`aur:` + per-distro tag sections into `packages:` + `distros:` map |
| 2026.124.1942 | shell-schema | legacy shell-rc heredoc `cmd:` tasks → structured `shell:` schema |
| 2026.125.702 | ov-cachyos | collapse `qc` → `cachyos-dx` → `ov-cachyos` deployment + kind:local template names |
| 2026.125.1107 | local-images | kind:local `images:` field → dated comment fence (deploy-fetch narrowing) |
| 2026.125.2355 | kind-files | split inline `image:`/`vm:` into sibling files, stub `pod.yml`/`k8s.yml`, `kind: deployment`→`kind: deploy`, root `deployment:`→`deploy:` |
| 2026.128.255 | local-deploy | `~/.config/ov/deploy.yml`: `images:`→`deploy:`, `bind_mounts:`→`volumes:`, `workspace:` scalar → bind volume |
| 2026.128.306 | quadlets | regenerate encrypted-volume quadlets missing the `ExecStartPre=ov config mount` auto-mount hook |
| 2026.130.1530 | field-singular | singularize every plural overthink-NATIVE authoring key project-wide (`layers:`→`layer:`, `ports:`→`port:`, `platforms:`→`platform:`, `env_provides:`→`env_provide:`, …; `builds:`→`produce:`). EXTERNAL-schema keys are kept PLURAL — fields rendered to cloud-init / Kubernetes / libvirt config use those schemas' own plural keys (`users:`, `labels:`, `resources:`, `<devices>`, `<topology sockets= cores=>`), so authoring them in the same plural spelling keeps a 1:1 mapping. The kept-plural set = keys living in `cloud_init_types.go` / `k8s_spec.go` / `k8s_config.go` / `libvirt_yaml.go`. Verb-collision carve-outs: `groups`/`addrs` |
| 2026.131.857 | marimo-rename | `marimo-ml` image + `marimo-ml-pod` deploy → `versa` (cross-kind name reuse) |
| 2026.132.1009 | require-image | inject the required `image:` field on every `target: pod` deploy entry |
| 2026.132.2311 | tailscale-secrets | rename flat `TS_AUTHKEY` → per-tailnet `TS_AUTHKEY_<TAILNET>` (non-interactive: auto-detect from a running sidecar or warn) |
| 2026.141.1326 | drop-kdbx | strip residual `secret_backend: kdbx` + `secrets_kdbx_*` keys from `~/.config/ov/config.yml` |
| **2026.141.1530** | **calver-schema** (HEAD) | **the universal stamper**: rewrite the top-level `version:` line of every versioned file to the HEAD CalVer (line-oriented, comment-preserving). This is the integer→CalVer transition (`version: 4` → the HEAD CalVer). **Always stays last** so `LatestSchemaVersion()` tracks it. |

Step `Name`s are for `--dry-run` / progress output only — they are no longer CLI sub-verbs. Steps that mutate per-host state (`~/.config/ov`, quadlets, `.secrets`) are flagged `TouchesHost`; see "Remote-cache auto-migration" below.

## How it runs

`RunMigrations(ctx)` walks `migrationSteps()` in order, calling each `Apply(ctx)`. Each step reports whether it changed anything; nothing-changed across the whole chain prints `nothing to migrate (already at schema <HEAD>)`. Per-step backups follow the established `<file>.bak.<unix-ts>` convention (field-singular, local-deploy, require-image, drop-kdbx, and the calver-schema stamp write them). `MigrateContext` (built by `NewMigrateContext`) carries the project dir, the per-host paths, the quadlet dir, the `.secrets` path, and `DryRun`.

### Remote-cache auto-migration (project-only)

`ov/refs.go` auto-runs `RunProjectMigrations(ctx)` on a freshly-cloned remote-repo cache so external repos pull through at the latest schema. `RunProjectMigrations` skips every `TouchesHost` step and leaves `HostDeployPath` empty, so a remote fetch **never mutates the user's per-host state** — even the calver-schema stamp touches only the cache's project files.

## Load-time gate

`LoadUnified` (`ov/unified.go`) parses the merged `version:` and rejects anything older than HEAD:

```
overthink.yml: schema 2026.141.1530 is required (found "4"). Run: ov migrate
```

A non-CalVer value (the legacy integer `4`, empty, or garbage) parses as "older than every real CalVer", so a pre-CalVer config flows into the chain with no special case. Residual-key checks (e.g. `kind: deployment`, `target: host`, `secret_backend: kdbx`) remain as defense-in-depth, but **every** remediation hint now points uniformly at bare `ov migrate`.

## Adding a future cutover

1. Write the transform as an idempotent `Migrate*` function (its own file, like the existing migrators).
2. Append ONE `MigrationStep` to `migrationSteps()` with a CalVer **strictly greater** than the current HEAD. Keep the `calver-schema` stamp **last**.
3. Bump `latestSchemaVersion` to the new step's CalVer (the two are asserted equal by `TestRegistryHeadMatchesLatest`).
4. Update the HEAD-CalVer fixtures (the LoadUnified test fixtures + `testdata/*.yml` carry the stamp) and the repo's own versioned YAML.

The operator command never changes — it stays `ov migrate`.

## Idempotency

Running `ov migrate` twice is a no-op (`TestMigrateCalverSchema_StampsAndIdempotent`, plus each migrator's own idempotency tests). The registry invariants (HEAD == `LatestSchemaVersion()`, strictly-ascending order, unique names) are enforced by `ov/migrate_registry_test.go`.
