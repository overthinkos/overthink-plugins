# yay -- AUR helper for Arch Linux

## Candy Properties

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| Install files | `charly.yml` (`run:` step) |
| Depends | none |

## Packages

PAC: `base-devel`, `git`

## Install Script

The `run:` step downloads the latest `yay` binary from GitHub releases:

```yaml
# yay charly.yml — a plan step is a child step node (no plan: list)
yay:
  candy:
    version: 2026.144.1443
  yay-step-0:
    run: download the latest yay binary from GitHub releases
    command: |
      ARCH=$(uname -m)
      URL=$(curl -fsSL https://api.github.com/repos/Jguer/yay/releases/latest \
        | grep -o "https://github.com/Jguer/yay/releases/download/[^\"]*_${ARCH}.tar.gz")
      curl -fsSL "$URL" | tar -xzf - -C /usr/local/bin --strip-components=1 --wildcards '*/yay'
```

Architecture-aware: downloads the correct binary for `x86_64` or `aarch64`.

## What It Does

Installs the `yay` AUR helper, which enables the `aur:` package format in `charly.yml`. Any candy with an `aur:` section requires a builder that has the `yay` candy (and `builds: [aur]` capability). The `base-devel` and `git` packages are prerequisites for building AUR packages.

## Usage

```yaml
# charly.yml — typically in a builder image (name-first; compose via a child node)
my-builder:
  candy:
    base: arch
  my-builder-candy:
    candy:
      - yay
```

Not used directly in end-user boxes. Instead, it's part of the builder image that compiles AUR packages during multi-stage builds.

## Used In Boxes

- `/charly-distros:arch-builder` — Arch build infrastructure image

## Related Candies

- `/charly-coder:build-toolchain` — C/C++ build tools (also in arch-builder)
- `/charly-distros:arch-aur-test` — test candy that validates AUR builds

## When to Use This Skill

Use when the user asks about:
- AUR package support in OpenCharly
- The `yay` candy or AUR helper installation
- How `aur:` packages in charly.yml get built
- The `arch-builder` box's AUR capability

## Related

- `/charly-image:layer` — candy authoring reference (`charly.yml` schema, plan-step verbs, service declarations)
- `/charly-check:check` — declarative testing (`check:` block, `charly check box`, `charly check live`)
