# Layer - Layer Authoring

## Overview

A **candy** is a directory under `candy/<name>/` that installs a single concern. Candies are the building blocks of container images in opencharly. Each candy is a **name-first node**: the top-level key is the candy NAME, under it a single `candy:` discriminator holds the **scalar** fields (`version`, `description`, `directory`, …), every collection (`package`, `env`, `service`, `volume`, …) is its own child node `<name>-<key>: {<key>: <value>}`, and every operational step is its own child node — all in a single `charly.yml` file.

There is **one YAML file per candy** for install logic — no separate Taskfiles. Everything an author needs to install flows through the `run:` step child nodes and auto-detected package manifests (`pixi.toml`, `package.json`, `Cargo.toml`).

**Layer vs image — ONE `candy:` kind (MUST).** There is exactly one entity kind,
`candy:`; there is **no `box:` KIND**. A `candy:` node carrying neither `base:`
nor `from:` is a **LAYER fragment** (this skill). A `candy:` node carrying `base:`
(an external base distro / OCI ref) **or** `from:` (a builder ref) is a full
**IMAGE** — author it per `/charly-image:image`. The loader routes a `candy:`
node to `uf.Box` (image) or `uf.Candy` (layer) purely on `base:`/`from:` presence;
`candy/<name>/` and `box/<name>/` remain the two discovery directories, and a
layer-named and image-named entity may coexist (distinct `uf.Candy` vs `uf.Box`
maps). The `charly box` COMMAND family is UNCHANGED — only the YAML `box:` KIND
keyword was removed.

## `directory:` — where the layer's config files live

A charly.yml's relative file references (`copy:` / `write:` step paths, `data.src`, install-file probes like `pixi.toml` / `package.json`, service-file globs) resolve against **`directory:`**, which defaults to `.` (the directory containing charly.yml).

Use `directory:` to keep charly.yml and its supporting config files in separate directories:

```yaml
# candy/my-app/charly.yml
my-app:
  candy:
    directory: ../../configs/my-app    # scalar — resolves relative to charly.yml's dir
  my-app-package:
    package: [foo]
  my-app-step-0:
    run: install the access-policy file
    copy: policies.json                # found at configs/my-app/policies.json
    to: /etc/my-app/policies.json
```

Resolution rule:
- `""` or `"."` → same dir as charly.yml (the default)
- relative path → joined onto charly.yml's dir
- absolute path → used as-is

`charly box validate` fails when `directory:` points at a path that doesn't exist.

## Node-form (name-first, child nodes)

Every charly.yml is self-describing. A candy flattens to a top-level `<name>:` key (the entity NAME); under it a single `candy:` discriminator holds ONLY the scalar fields, every collection becomes a child node `<name>-<key>: {<key>: <value>}`, and every operational step becomes its own child node (keyed by its `id:`, else auto-keyed `<name>-step-<N>`). This name-first shape is globally addressable, so candy files stay bundle-mergeable — stack the top-level keys (or concatenate with `---` separators) to form a single file containing many candies.

```yaml
# candy/chrome/charly.yml
chrome:
  candy:
    directory: .
  chrome-package:
    package: [chromium]
  chrome-step-0:
    run: install the chrome managed-policy file
    copy: policies.json
    to: /etc/chromium/policies/managed/policy.json
```

The runtime parser accepts only this node-form. `charly migrate` converts any legacy candy file — the old kind-keyed `candy: {name, …}` wrapper and its inline `plan:` list — to the canonical shape in a single idempotent pass.

The candy + plan-step schema the parser validates against is **CUE-single-source**: the `@go()`-annotated `charly/schema/*.cue` defs (`#Candy`, `#Op`, …) are the sole source for both the Go param structs (generated into `charly/spec` by `task cue:gen`) and load-time validation, so adding or changing a candy field is a CUE edit → `task cue:gen` → see the `/charly-internals:go` recipe "Updating Go code when an ingress CUE schema changes".

## Quick Reference

| Action | Command | Description |
|--------|---------|-------------|
| Scaffold new candy | `charly box new candy <name>` | Create candy directory with starter `charly.yml` (see `/charly-build:new`) |
| Edit a candy field | `charly candy set <name> <dotpath> <value>` | Comment-preserving YAML edit by dot-path |
| Append rpm/deb/pac/aur packages | `charly candy add-rpm <name> <pkg…>` (plus `add-deb`, `add-pac`, `add-aur`) | Idempotent append; auto-upgrades scaffold's null `package:` to a sequence |
| Add a plan step (`run:` / `check:` / agent step) | hand-edit a step child node in `charly.yml`, or `charly candy set <name> <dotpath> <value>` | No dedicated convenience command — author step child nodes by hand or via the comment-preserving dot-path setter (and `charly box write` for free-form files). See `/charly-check:check` "Agent Driven Evaluation" |
| Write a free-form file (`pixi.toml`, `root.yml`, …) | `charly box write <rel-path> --content X` | Escape hatch for files the schema setters don't cover; guarded against `..` traversal |
| List all candies | `charly box list candies` | Show available candies from filesystem |
| List services | `charly box list services` | Candies with `service` in charly.yml |
| List volumes | `charly box list volumes` | Candies with `volumes` in charly.yml |
| List aliases | `charly box list aliases` | Candies with `aliases` in charly.yml |
| Validate | `charly box validate` | Check all candies and boxes |

Every editor verb above auto-becomes an MCP tool via Kong reflection (`candy.set`, `candy.add-rpm`, `box.write`, …) so an agent driving `charly mcp serve` can author candies from scratch over RPC without touching the filesystem directly. See `/charly-build:charly-mcp-cmd` "Authoring tools" for the worked end-to-end example, and `/charly-build:new` for the project / box / candy scaffolders that bootstrap the flow.

### Editing charly.yml via the CLI (no hand-edit required)

The `charly candy …` group edits `candy/<name>/charly.yml` through the `yaml.v3` Node API, so **comments and key order are preserved** across edits. Unlike unmarshal-then-marshal, nothing gets scrambled when an agent (or a shell script) touches the file:

> The top-level `charly candy` authoring tree is an **external COMMAND-class plugin** (`candy/plugin-candy`, `command:candy`) — one of cutover C15's four remaining welded-command externalizations (after `tmux`/`preempt`/`feature`/`vm`/`doctor`). The user-facing command tree is unchanged; only its CLI registration moved out-of-process. The plugin is a THIN forwarder: charly resolves the `candy` word via the discovered (or `/usr/lib/charly/plugins`-baked) plugin and syscall.Exec's it in CLI mode, which raw-forwards every subcommand token (kong passthrough) to the hidden in-core `charly __candy` command. The `CandyCmd` handlers (`charly/scaffold_cmds.go`) STAY core because they mutate `candy/<name>/charly.yml` via the `yaml.v3` Node API behind the `resolveProjectFile` traversal guard. (This is NOT `charly new candy` — `NewCandyCmd`, a child of `charly new` — which stays a builtin.)

```bash
# Append packages (idempotent; handles scaffold's null `package:` value):
charly candy add-rpm sshd openssh-server openssh-clients
charly candy add-deb sshd openssh-server
charly candy add-pac sshd openssh

# Set any field by dot-path (value is parsed as YAML):
charly candy set sshd env.SSHD_PORT 22
charly candy set sshd service.name sshd
charly candy set sshd port '["22:22"]'
charly candy set sshd require '[supervisord]'

# Free-form files (layer scripts, pixi.toml, root.yml, *.service):
charly box write candy/sshd/sshd_config.d/99-charly.conf --content 'X11Forwarding no\n'
charly box cat candy/sshd/sshd_config.d/99-charly.conf
```

Implementation: `charly/scaffold_cmds.go` (verbs) + `charly/yaml_setter.go` (`SetByDotPath`). Tested in `charly/yaml_setter_test.go` — the comment-preservation guarantee is explicitly exercised (leading file comments, sibling keys, and per-key inline comments all survive round trips). See `/charly-internals:go` "Implementation insights" for the full rationale.

## Install Surface (what a layer directory holds)

A candy directory can contain any combination of these:

| Artifact | Runs as | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `charly.yml` `distro:` map (+ top-level `package:` base) | root | System packages declared declaratively (see Package Surface below) |
| `charly.yml` `run:` step child nodes | per-step `run_as:` | Ordered install operations — the primary extension point (see catalog below) |
| `pixi.toml` / `pyproject.toml` / `environment.yml` | user (builder stage) | Python/conda packages. Multi-stage build. Only one per candy |
| `package.json` | user (builder stage) | npm packages — installed globally via `npm install -g` |
| `Cargo.toml` + `src/` | user (builder stage) | Rust crate — built via `cargo install --path` |
| `build.sh` | user (builder stage) | Optional post-install script for pixi candies. Runs in the pixi builder after `pixi install`. For build-time logic that can't be expressed in pixi.toml (C extension compilation, npm builds, binary patching). |

**Auto-detection:** The build system scans each candy directory for these files. `pixi.toml`, `pyproject.toml`, `environment.yml`, `package.json`, and `Cargo.toml` trigger automatic multi-stage builds — no manual install commands needed. Use `run:` steps only for things those manifests can't express (binary downloads, file copies from `/ctx`, inline config writes, post-install configuration, `go install`, etc.).

**Root vs user rule:** Pixi/npm/cargo builders always run as user — never as root. For `run:` steps, the `run_as:` field per step is explicit: `run_as: root` for system-wide changes, `run_as: ${USER}` for anything under `${HOME}`, or a literal username for custom users (must be created earlier in the same candy via a `command:` step).

## Plan Step Verb Catalog

Every state-change step is a `run:` **child node**: a YAML map keyed by the step's `id:` (else auto-keyed `<name>-step-<N>`) carrying `run: <prose>` plus **exactly one verb key** (the discriminator) and optional sibling modifiers. The verb's value is the primary argument. `charly box validate` rejects `run:` steps with zero verbs or multiple verbs. (A candy's step child nodes also hold `check:` probe steps and `agent-run:` / `agent-check:` agent steps — see `/charly-check:check` for their verb surface.)

| Verb | Value | Required modifiers | Optional modifiers | Purpose |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `command:` | shell command (multi-line OK) | — | `run_as`, `comment` | Arbitrary shell — last-resort escape hatch |
| `mkdir:` | directory path | — | `run_as`, `mode`, `comment` | Create directory (`mkdir -p`; coalesces with adjacent) |
| `copy:` | source relative to layer dir | `to:` | `run_as`, `mode`, `comment` | `COPY --from=<layer-stage> --chmod= [--chown=]` — no RUN |
| `write:` | destination path | `content:` | `run_as`, `mode`, `comment` | Write inline content — staged + COPY, no shell heredoc |
| `link:` | symlink path (where the link lives) | `target:` | `run_as`, `comment` | `ln -sf <target> <link>` (coalesces with adjacent) |
| `download:` | URL | — (`to:` unless `extract: sh`) | `run_as`, `extract`, `to`, `extract_include`, `strip_components`, `mode`, `env`, `comment` | `curl` + optional extract (`tar.gz`/`tar.xz`/`tar.zst`/`zip`/`none`/`sh`). `strip_components: N` emits `tar --strip-components=N` for tar.* — drops leading path segments so tarballs that nest under a top-level arch/version dir (Go, Rust, Node binary releases) land files directly at `to:`. See `/charly-coder:uv` for the canonical uv-x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu/uv → /usr/local/bin/uv example. |
| `setcap:` | file path | — | `run_as` (implicit root), `caps`, `comment` | File capabilities (`setcap -r` strip if `caps` empty) |
| `build:` | `"all"` | — | `run_as` (default `${USER}`), `comment` | Run auto-detected builders (pixi/npm/cargo/aur) at this point (instead of end-of-candy) |

### Shared modifiers

| Modifier | Applies to | Default | Purpose |
|---|---|---|---|
| `run_as` | all verbs | `root` | `root` / `${USER}` / literal username / `<uid>:<gid>` |
| `mode` | `mkdir`, `copy`, `write`, `download` | type-specific (`0755`/`0644`) | Octal permissions |
| `to` | `copy`, `download` | — | Destination in container |
| `target` | `link` | — | What the symlink points to |
| `content` | `write` | — | Inline file body (YAML block scalar) |
| `extract` | `download` | `none` | Archive format — `tar.gz` / `tar.xz` / `tar.zst` / `zip` / `none` / `sh` |
| `extract_include` | `download` | — | Extract only these paths (archive formats) |
| `env` | `download` | — | Env vars for install scripts (`sh` extract) |
| `caps` | `setcap` | empty (= strip) | Capability spec (e.g. `cap_setuid=ep`) |
| `cache` | `command`, `download` | — | List of absolute BuildKit cache-mount paths for this step's RUN. Ownership follows `run_as:` (root → shared/locked, non-root → uid/gid-owned). Persists heavy downloads/build artifacts across builds the SAME way package caches do — surviving an upstream layer cache-miss. The cache-USE logic (sentinel guards, copy-into-place) lives in the step body; charly only mounts the cache. See "Caching downloads" below. |
| `comment` | all | — | Emitted as a Containerfile comment above the step |

### Plugin verb steps (`plugin:`)

A `run:` step can carry `plugin: <word>` + `plugin_input: {…}` instead of a built-in verb — it dispatches to the reserved word's `Provider`. In the BUILD context the step EXECUTES at image-build time to emit its Containerfile fragment, served PLACEMENT-AGNOSTICALLY: the SAME plugin works whether it is compiled into `charly` (a builtin) OR loaded from an out-of-tree candy (an EXTERNAL plugin, host-built + connected during generation). A builtin renders an act shell `RUN` in-proc; an external returns a Containerfile fragment over go-plugin gRPC, spliced verbatim (egress-validated). See `/charly-internals:plugin` (placement) + `/charly-build:generate` (the build-time emit).

### External multi-stage builder (`external_builder:`)

A candy may set `external_builder: <word>` — the reserved word of an OUT-OF-TREE builder plugin (an external `ClassBuilder` provider, `builder:<word>`) — to contribute a multi-stage build at IMAGE BUILD. The generator resolves the word, `Invoke(OpResolve)`s the provider, and splices the returned reply: its `FROM…AS` stage PRE-main-FROM and its `COPY --from=<stage>` artifacts POST-main-FROM. This is the build-time BUILDER leg, the multi-stage counterpart of a `run:` step's `plugin:` verb. A built-in builder (pixi/cargo/npm/aur) is selected by detection files (`pixi.toml`, `Cargo.toml`, `package.json`, `aur:`), NOT this field. A candy whose only content is `external_builder:` is valid (it ships no install files). See `/charly-internals:plugin` (placement) + `/charly-build:generate` (the build-time emit).

### Caching downloads (`download:` auto-caches; `cache:` for heavy installers)

Every `download:` step is **content-addressed cached automatically**: the file
is fetched ONCE into the shared `/tmp/downloads` BuildKit cache mount (keyed by
the URL's sha256), reused across builds, and integrity-safe (curl writes
`<hash>.part`, atomically renamed only on success — a partial/corrupt download,
e.g. from a flaky CDN, is never reused). No author action needed; prefer
`download:` over a hand-rolled `command: curl …`.

For a `command:` step that downloads/builds via its own tool (an SDK installer, a
source build) and so can't use `download:`, declare a `cache:` mount and route
the tool's downloads into it. Canonical worked example — caching the Android SDK
so an upstream base cache-miss doesn't re-download ~1.5GB from Google's CDN:

```yaml
android-sdk-cache:                                  # step child node, keyed by id
  run: cache and install the android sdk
  command: |
    SDK_CACHE=/var/cache/charly-android-sdk
    if [ ! -f "${SDK_CACHE}/.charly-sdk-complete" ]; then
      rm -rf "${SDK_CACHE}"; mkdir -p "${SDK_CACHE}"
      sdkmanager --sdk_root="${SDK_CACHE}" "platform-tools" "emulator" "system-images;…"
      touch "${SDK_CACHE}/.charly-sdk-complete"   # sentinel: only after full success
    fi
    cp -a "${SDK_CACHE}/." /opt/android-sdk/   # materialize into the image
  run_as: user
  cache:
    - /var/cache/charly-android-sdk                 # owned (uid) because run_as: user
```

The sentinel (`.charly-sdk-complete`, written only after a fully-successful install)
guards against a partial/interrupted download populating the cache. AUR builds
get the same treatment via the embedded build vocabulary's `aur` builder (owned `cache_mount`
entries for makepkg `SRCDEST` + yay's clone cache) — see `/charly-build:build`.

### `copy:` vs `write:` — never conflate

They happen to emit `COPY` directives under the hood, but they have entirely distinct semantics:

| | `copy` | `write` |
|---|---|---|
| Source of bytes | File on disk under `candy/<name>/` | Inline `content:` block in `charly.yml` |
| Replaces old pattern | `cp /ctx/foo bar` + `chmod` | `cat > foo << 'EOF' … EOF` |
| Validation check | `src` must exist under candy dir at generate time | `content` must be non-empty |
| Cache key | Layer-stage file content | Content-addressed staged file at `.build/<image>/_inline/<layer>/<sha256>` |
| Shell-heredoc involvement | None | **None** — content never appears in the Containerfile |

`write:` is the heredoc-safe path: the YAML `content:` is staged to disk at generate time and delivered via `COPY`. That means `$`, backticks, nested `EOF` markers, and arbitrary binary-safe text are all handled without any escaping. If you find yourself writing `cat > foo << 'EOF'` inside a `command:` block, use `write:` instead.

---

## `var:` and `${VAR}` Substitution

`var:` is a candy-local `map[string]string`. Values are emitted as `ENV` before the candy's `run:`/`check:` steps, so every subsequent directive in the candy (including `COPY --chmod=` paths) sees them as shell-resolvable `${VAR}` references.

```yaml
traefik-var:
  var:
    TRAEFIK_VERSION: v3.4.0

traefik-binary:
  run: install the traefik release binary
  download: "https://github.com/traefik/traefik/releases/download/${TRAEFIK_VERSION}/traefik_${TRAEFIK_VERSION}_linux_${ARCH}.tar.gz"
  extract: tar.gz
  to: /usr/local/bin
  extract_include: [traefik]
  run_as: root
```

### Auto-exports

These names are reserved — `var:` may not shadow them:

| Name | Value | Resolution |
|---|---|---|
| `USER` | image's configured username | Generate-time (from charly.yml resolution) |
| `UID` | numeric user ID | Generate-time |
| `GID` | numeric group ID | Generate-time |
| `HOME` | resolved home directory | Generate-time |
| `ARCH` | BuildKit-style: `amd64` / `arm64` / `ppc64le` / `s390x` | Build-time via `ARG TARGETARCH` + `ENV ARCH=${TARGETARCH}` at candy top |
| `BUILD_ARCH` | uname-style: `x86_64` / `aarch64` / … | Build-time, shell-only (auto-injected inside `command:` and `download:` as `BUILD_ARCH=$(uname -m)`) |

**Why two `ARCH` flavours:** `${ARCH}` is BuildKit form because that's what most upstream release naming uses (traefik, mcp-grafana, cosign, etc.). `${BUILD_ARCH}` is uname form because a handful of projects (pixi, yay, just, typst) use `x86_64`/`aarch64` in their release filenames. Pick whichever matches your URL template — the generator handles both.

### Where substitution applies

`${VAR}` is resolved in every `run:`/`check:` step field **except**:

- `command:` command text — passed verbatim to bash so shell-style `${VAR:-default}`, `$(command)`, and `$NAME` all work the way you'd expect. **But** RUN shells don't have `$USER` exported by default — use `getent passwd <UID>` for user-name discovery inside `command:`, not `$USER`.
- `write: content:` — the file body is verbatim bytes (never substituted, never heredoc'd). If you need the resolved `${USER}` inside a file, use a `command:` step that writes via shell redirect after discovering the name via `getent passwd 1000 | cut -d: -f1`. Canonical worked example: `/charly-coder:sshd`'s sudoers drop-in.

Everything else (paths, URLs, modes, `to`, `target`, `user`, etc.) resolves via the Docker-level ENV mechanism, so BuildKit sees the values and substitutes in COPY/RUN/ENV directives.

**Why `$USER` isn't reliable in `command:`** — the generator resolves `${USER}` in step fields (paths, `run_as:` directive, COPY --chown) at generate time. But `command:` body text is passed through to bash at RUN time, and bash at RUN time doesn't export `$USER` unless the image explicitly set it via an `ENV USER=` directive (which we don't). `getent passwd <UID>` is the robust, fully-generic alternative that works equally under create mode (`user`) and adopt mode (`ubuntu`) — see `/charly-image:image` "user_policy".

### Validation

- `var:` keys must match `^[A-Z_][A-Z0-9_]*$` (standard shell identifier)
- Keys may not collide with auto-exports or with the candy's own `env:` keys
- Unresolved `${VAR}` in non-shell fields (paths, URLs, etc.) errors at `charly box validate`

---

## Style: Explicit Plan Steps, No YAML Anchors

Every `run:` step — root or user — must be written out in full. Do **not** use YAML anchors (`&name`, `<<: *name`) to share `run_as:` / `mode:` across steps. `gopkg.in/yaml.v3` parses anchors correctly, but the repo convention is that every `charly.yml` plan step reads end-to-end without indirection.

```yaml
# Style across the repo — root and user step nodes look identical in shape:
traefik-config-dir:
  run: create the traefik config directory
  mkdir: /etc/traefik
  run_as: root
  mode: "0755"

local-bin-dir:
  run: create the user's local bin directory
  mkdir: "${HOME}/.local/bin"
  run_as: "${USER}"

chrome-wrapper-install:
  run: install the chrome wrapper
  copy: chrome-wrapper
  to: "${HOME}/.local/bin/chrome-wrapper"
  mode: "0755"
  run_as: "${USER}"
chrome-restart-install:
  run: install the chrome restart helper
  copy: chrome-restart
  to: "${HOME}/.local/bin/chrome-restart"
  mode: "0755"
  run_as: "${USER}"
```

Why: anchor merges always override the verb (the interesting field), so the DRY saving is 1–2 trivial fields per step at the cost of forcing readers to jump to the anchor definition to understand each step. Adjacent-coalescing in the generator already collapses identical consecutive operations into one Containerfile directive — there is no build-time cost to explicit repetition.

---

## Execution Order

**Plan `run:` steps run in the exact YAML order you wrote them. No reordering, ever.** This is load-bearing: `download` before `copy` that references the downloaded path; `mkdir` before `copy` into that directory; `command useradd` before `command` as that new user.

### Adjacent-coalescing (the only rendering optimisation)

When two or more consecutive `run:` steps share the same verb AND the same resolved `run_as:` AND the verb supports batching, they render into one Containerfile directive instead of N. This is pure output optimisation — the operations still happen in authored sequence, and no step ever moves past a different-verb or different-user step.

| Verb | Coalesces adjacent same-user? | Output |
|---|---|---|
| `mkdir` | Yes | `RUN mkdir -p p1 p2 p3 …` (one RUN; `chmod` grouped by mode) |
| `link` | Yes | `RUN ln -sf t1 l1 && ln -sf t2 l2 …` |
| `setcap` | Yes | `RUN setcap …` chain |
| `copy` | No coalescing needed | Multiple `COPY` directives back-to-back, no RUN between them |
| `write` | No coalescing needed | Same as `copy` but from staged-inline content |
| `download` | No | Each URL gets its own RUN — merging would hide failures |
| `command` | No | Each `command:` maps 1:1 to one RUN — merging arbitrary shell would erase author intent |
| `build` | Singleton | One per candy (auto or explicit) |

**Non-adjacent same-verb steps never coalesce.** `mkdir /a` → `copy foo /a/foo` → `mkdir /b` renders as three directives, not two. Collapsing the two mkdirs would change observable state (the copy would see a different directory layout) and is forbidden.

### `mkdir -p` ancestor registration

When you declare `mkdir: /a/b/c`, the generator also treats `/a` and `/a/b` as "declared" — because Unix `mkdir -p` creates the full path. That means a later `copy` into `/a/b/foo` won't trigger a redundant auto-inserted `mkdir /a/b`. This matches author intent: you wrote one mkdir, you get one mkdir, even if multiple COPYs land under the same tree.

### Parent-directory auto-insertion

The single, tightly-scoped exception to "no implicit inserts": if a `copy:` or `write:` step's destination parent isn't already declared (directly or via ancestor-registration above), the generator prepends a single `RUN mkdir -p <parent>` (as the step's `run_as:`) **immediately before** the COPY — never relocating anything, never merging across other steps. To opt out of auto-insertion for a specific path, declare the parent explicitly with `mkdir:` earlier in the list.

### USER directives

The generator tracks the running USER and emits `USER <value>` only when the next step's resolved user differs. Eight consecutive `${USER}` steps get one `USER 1000` directive followed by eight directives — no redundant switches. Between different-user steps, a `USER` switch happens where author order requires.

---

## User Resolution

The `run_as:` field accepts:

| Value | Emits | COPY `--chown` pair |
|---|---|---|
| `root` / `"0"` / omitted | `USER 0` | — (root is the COPY default) |
| `${USER}` | `USER <numeric UID>` | `<UID>:<GID>` (e.g. `1000:1000`) |
| `<uid>:<gid>` (e.g. `1010:1010`) | `USER <uid>:<gid>` | same |
| bare numeric `<uid>` | `USER <uid>` | `<uid>:<uid>` |
| literal name (`postgres`, `immich`) | `USER <name>` | `<name>:<name>` |

**Why `${USER}` resolves to a numeric UID:** avoids a `/etc/passwd` dependency at the instant the switch happens. Base images create the named user, but numeric always works even if `/etc/passwd` hasn't been read yet by whatever shell the RUN spawns.

**User creation is explicit.** If you reference a literal username, an earlier `command:` step (as root) must `useradd` them. The generator does not auto-create users. Example:

```yaml
immich-user:
  run: create the immich service user
  command: |
    useradd -r -u 1010 -g root -s /sbin/nologin immich
    mkdir -p /srv/immich && chown -R immich:root /srv/immich
  run_as: root
immich-build:
  run: build immich as that user
  command: |
    cd /srv/immich
    pnpm install --frozen-lockfile
    pnpm build
  run_as: immich
```

## charly.yml Field Reference

| Field | Type | Purpose |
|-------|------|---------|
| `version` | `string` | **MANDATORY** CalVer (`YYYY.DDD.HHMM`) of this candy definition — the candy kind requires it (`charly box validate` hard-errors when absent; `charly migrate` backfills it). The authoritative per-entity identity: it drives cross-repo layer resolution (`pickCandyVersion`) and, as the highest layer version, the consuming image's content-stable `ai.opencharly.version` label. Bump it when the candy's content changes. |
| `status` | `string` | `working`, `testing`, or `broken`. Default: `testing`. |
| `info` | `string` | Free-form description of what works / doesn't. Recommended for `testing` / `broken`. |
| `require` | `[]string` | Candy dependencies. Resolved transitively, topologically sorted. |
| `layer` | `[]string` | Compose other candies into this one (splicing). |
| `env` | `map[string]string` | Container-runtime environment variables. Merged across candies. |
| `path_append` | `[]string` | Paths appended to `$PATH`. Deduplicated. |
| `var` | `map[string]string` | **Build-time** candy-local variables for `${VAR}` substitution. Emitted as `ENV` before plan steps. |
| step nodes | `Step` each | The **ordered** operational plan, expressed as step CHILD NODES — each keyed by its `id:` (else auto-keyed `<name>-step-<N>`), carrying ONE intent keyword `run:` (state-change) / `check:` / `agent-run:` / `agent-check:` (probes) / `include: <kind>:<name>` (splice another entity's plan) plus an inline Op. Steps run in authored order. Every candy MUST ship ≥1 `check:` step (the ADE gate; `charly box validate` hard-errors otherwise). See Plan Step Verb Catalog above. |
| `port` | `[]int \| []PortSpec` | The candy's **container** ports (1-65535) — the SINGLE source of truth for published ports. Every box composing this candy inherits them (`CollectBoxPorts`); boxes declare no `port:`. Host mappings are auto-allocated on `127.0.0.1` at deploy. Protocol-annotated form: `tcp:5900`, `https+insecure:3000`, etc. (the backend scheme rides into `ai.opencharly.port_proto`). |
| `route` | `{host, port}` | Traefik reverse proxy route. |
| `service` | multiline string | Supervisord `[program:<name>]` fragment. |
| `package` / `distro` | list / map | The package surface: top-level `package:` base + per-distro/version `distro:` map (bare / versioned / compound keys). Resolved via the most-specific-first cascade (see Package Surface). |
| `apk` | `[]ApkPackageSpec` | **Android app-install package format** — apps installed onto a `kind: android` device by a `target: android` deploy (NOT into the image). Each entry is `package:` (apkeep download by id, with `source`/`arch`/`version`) XOR `apk:` (committed local APK). Device-scoped (top-level, not under `distro:`); compiles to an `ApkInstallStep` that ONLY `target: android` executes (skipped at image-build + on every other target). See `/charly-check:android`. |
| `localpkg` | map (format→dir) | **Native-package deploy format** (sibling of `apk`). A per-format map (`pac`/`rpm`/`deb` → a bundled package SOURCE dir, e.g. the `charly` layer's `{pac: pkg/arch, rpm: pkg/fedora, deb: pkg/debian}`). Compiles to a `LocalPkgInstallStep` (`/charly-internals:install-plan`) emitted at "step 2.5", BEFORE the layer's `run:` steps. On a DEPLOY target (`target: local` / `target: vm`) charly picks the entry matching the target distro's package format, builds the package on the HOST (pac via `makepkg`; rpm/deb distro-natively in a podman container), and installs it via the format's AUTO-RESOLVING local-file install (`pacman -U` / `dnf install` / `apt-get install`) — so the package's repo dependencies resolve automatically and there is NO dependency-closure builder. Every command (build / install / probe / glob / `source_sentinel`) is rendered from the distro's `format.<fmt>.local_pkg:` block in the embedded build vocabulary — zero hardcoded package-manager literals in Go. The legacy scalar form (`localpkg: pkg/arch`) is rejected at load with an `charly migrate` hint. Resolution walks up from the deploy project dir, so a consumer under `box/<distro>` finds the superproject's `pkg/<fmt>`. Skipped at image build — the layer's own `run:` steps (curl/COPY) are the fallback. The `charly` layer uses this to install `charly` as the native OS package at `/usr/bin/charly` on every distro instead of a curl'd binary. |
| `volumes` | `[]{name, path}` | Persistent named volumes. |
| `aliases` | `[]{name, command}` | Host command aliases. |
| `security` | object | Container security: `privileged`, `cap_add`, `devices`, `security_opt`, `shm_size`, resource caps. |
| `port_relay` | `[]int` | Ports needing eth0 → loopback socat relay. Auto-adds `socat` dependency. |
| `secrets` | `[]SecretYAML` | Image-owned container secrets (auto-generated per instance). |
| `hooks` | `HooksConfig` | Lifecycle hooks: `post_enable` (after `charly config`), `pre_remove` (before `charly remove`). |
| `libvirt` | `[]string` | Raw libvirt XML snippets for VM domain XML injection. |
| `data` | `[]DataYAML` | Data mappings (`src` → volume `dest`) for volume staging. |
| `env_provide` | `map[string]string` | Env vars injected into OTHER containers when this service is deployed. Template: `{{.ContainerName}}`. |
| `env_require` | `[]EnvDependency` | Plaintext env vars this candy MUST have. Hard error at `charly config` if missing. |
| `env_accept` | `[]EnvDependency` | Plaintext env vars this candy CAN optionally use. Opt-in allowlist for `env_provide` injection. |
| `secret_accept` / `secret_require` | `[]EnvDependency` | Credential-backed env vars. Values live in credential store, never in charly.yml/quadlet. |
| `mcp_provide` / `mcp_require` / `mcp_accept` | various | MCP server discovery analogous to `env_*`. |
| `service` | `[]ServiceEntry` | Unified service list — see "Service Declaration" below. |

Field details for the non-step collection sections are below.

## Package Surface — the `distro:` map (single canonical surface)

Packages are declared ONLY under the `distro:` child node, plus an optional
`package:` base (its own `<name>-package:` child node). There is NO `rpm:` / `deb:` / `pac:` package-format
key and NO top-level `debian:13:` / `debian,ubuntu:` tag key — those legacy forms
are removed (a stray one is a hard load error pointing at `charly migrate`, which the
existing `calamares` step rewrites into the `distro:` map). The arch `aur:`
sub-block is the one exception that stays a build format — see AUR below.

> **Calamares package groups MUST use the `package-group:` kind, NOT `group:`.**
> A `package-group:` entity is a Calamares installer package group (the `#Group`
> schema — `name`/`package`/`subgroup`/`distro`/…). `group:` is EXCLUSIVELY a
> targetless DEPLOY group (resource members, no own workload — see
> `/charly-core:deploy`). The two are distinct kinds; authoring a Calamares group
> under `group:` is wrong.

```yaml
my-app-package:            # the always-included BASE — installed on EVERY distro
  package:
    - git                  #   (cross-distro-valid package names)

my-app-distro:
  distro:
    fedora:                # bare distro name → applies to every fedora version
      package: [vim, ripgrep]
      copr: [owner/project]
      option: ["--setopt=tsflags=noscripts"]
    arch:
      package: [vim, ripgrep]
    "debian,ubuntu":       # COMPOUND → shared by both (split into one tag each)
      package: [vim, ripgrep]
      repo:                # /etc/apt/sources.list.d/<name>.list + keyring
        - name: myrepo
          url: "https://example.com/repo"
          key: "https://example.com/key.gpg"   # ASCII-armored; gpg --dearmor'd
          suite: stable
          components: main
    ubuntu-24.04:          # VERSIONED (dash form) → overrides for that version only
      repo: [{name: nodesource, url: "...", suite: nodistro, components: main}]
```

### Key forms (all under `distro:`)

| Form | Example | Means |
|---|---|---|
| bare distro | `fedora` / `debian` / `ubuntu` / `arch` | every version of that distro |
| versioned | `debian-13` / `ubuntu-24.04` | that specific version (dash form — robust YAML) |
| compound | `"debian,ubuntu"` / `"debian-13,ubuntu-24.04"` | shared across the listed distros/versions (split into one per distro) |

Each carries the full surface: `package` + `repo` + `copr` + `option` + `exclude`
+ `module` (and `aur` under `arch`). `repo` is the canonical key (singular).

### Resolution is a most-specific-first CASCADE

For an image, the resolver walks the image's `distro:` tag chain — most-specific
first (e.g. `[ubuntu:24.04, ubuntu]` or `[debian:13, debian]`) — plus the
`package:` base child node:

- **packages = UNION** across the base + every matching level (deduped). A shared
  package on a broad level plus extras on a specific level accumulate.
- **repo / copr / option / exclude / module = MOST-SPECIFIC matching level wins**
  (a `ubuntu-24.04` repo overrides the bare `ubuntu` repo).

This is what makes per-distro repos DETERMINISTIC: each distro owns its own tag
section, so debian and ubuntu can never race over one shared section (the old
collapse that made the apt suite — trixie vs noble — depend on Go map order).
Canonical examples: `/charly-tools:charly` (tailscale `debian`→trixie / `ubuntu`→noble),
`/charly-coder:docker-ce` (per-version repos), `/charly-tools:gh` (compound shared repo).

### The cascade cannot SUBTRACT — express exclusions structurally

Because packages UNION across the chain, you cannot have a specific level REMOVE a
package a broader level added. To keep a package OFF a distro/version, simply
never list it on any level that distro resolves. Worked example: `/charly-coder:dev-tools`
keeps `fastfetch` (absent from Ubuntu's repos) only under `debian` + `fedora` +
`arch` — NOT under `ubuntu` — so the ubuntu cascade never includes it.

### Image distro chains (where the most-specific-first order comes from)

An image declares its chain in `charly.yml` `distro:` (e.g. `[debian:13, debian]`,
`[ubuntu:24.04, ubuntu]`); a `target: vm` deploy synthesizes the SAME chain from
the distro's canonical `version:` in the embedded build vocabulary via `distroTagChain` — so
per-version selection works identically on image builds and VM deploys. fedora /
arch carry only a bare tag (`[fedora]` / `[arch]`) and reach their packages via
the bare-distro tag section. See `/charly-build:build` and `/charly-internals:install-plan`.

### Pac (`pac:`)

```yaml
pac:
  packages:
    - neovim
    - ripgrep
  repos:
    - name: custom-repo
      server: https://example.com/repo/$arch
      siglevel: Optional TrustAll    # default if omitted
  options:
    - --needed
```

### AUR (`aur:`)

AUR packages are compiled by `yay` in a multi-stage build, then the resulting
`.pkg.tar.zst` artifacts are `pacman -U`-installed into the final image. Two
conditions must BOTH hold for the AUR stage to be emitted:

1. The consuming **image declares `aur` in its `build:` list** (e.g.
   `build: [pac, aur]`). The `arch` AND `cachyos` bases both declare only
   `build: [pac]`, so a consumer that needs AUR MUST add `aur` itself (the
   `arch-test` and `selkies-desktop` precedents). Without it the AUR section is
   silently skipped — by design, so a multi-distro candy can carry `aur:` for
   Arch consumers without forcing every Fedora consumer to invoke a builder.
2. **`builder.aur` is configured** — `arch-builder` for BOTH the `arch` and
   `cachyos` bases. CachyOS is Arch-derived and routes all four
   pixi/npm/cargo/aur formats to `arch-builder`, so an `aur:` layer builds
   **identically on arch and cachyos** — there is no cachyos-specific AUR path.

**Canonical form — nested under `distro.arch`** (how the repo's candies author it:
`chrome`, `vscode`, `wl-tools`). The `aur:` block sits beside the regular
`package:` list inside the arch distro section, so ONE candy carries Fedora RPMs
and Arch repo + AUR packages together; the generator picks the section matching
the image's `distro:` tags:

```yaml
chrome-distro:
  distro:
    arch:
      package:                 # Arch repo (core/extra) packages
        - vulkan-icd-loader
      aur:                     # AUR packages — need build: [pac, aur] on the image
        package:
          - google-chrome
        options:
          - --nocheck
        # `replaces:` lists distro-repo packages whose file paths conflict
        # with the AUR build artifact. Each entry is removed via
        # `pacman -Rs --noconfirm <pkg>` BEFORE the AUR `pacman -U` install.
        # Idempotent — entries that aren't installed are silently skipped.
        # Required when the AUR build owns paths also owned by an Arch repo
        # package (e.g. `visual-studio-code-bin` and `code` both own /usr/bin/code).
        replaces:
          - code
    fedora:
      package:
        - vulkan-loader
```

A top-level `aur:` block (sibling of `pac:`, with a plural `packages:` list) is
the single-distro shorthand for an Arch-only candy; both forms flatten to the
same internal `aur` format section (`charly/layers.go` `derivePackageSectionsFromCalamares`).
Prefer the nested `distro.arch.aur.package` form for multi-distro candies.

The `replaces:` mechanism applies to host (`target: local`) deploys; in OCI image builds the candy is applied to a fresh rootfs that never has the conflicting package, so `replaces:` is a no-op there.

---

## Dependencies

Candies declare dependencies via `require`. The generator resolves transitively, topologically sorts, and pulls missing dependencies automatically. Circular dependencies are a validation error.

```yaml
my-app-require:
  require:
    - python
    - supervisord
```

### `require` vs `layer`

| | `require` | `layer` |
|---|---|---|
| Purpose | Prerequisite ordering | Group composition |
| Effect | Ensures dependency is installed first | Splices candies at this candy's position |
| Transitive | Yes — pulls in sub-dependencies | Yes — recursively expands |
| Typical use | Runtime/build prerequisites | Metalayers, candy bundles |

**Common mistake:** `require: [pixi]` when you mean `require: [python]`. The `pixi` candy installs the pixi binary (build tool). The `python` candy installs Python via pixi. Your candy needs Python.

---

## Environment Variables

```yaml
my-app-env:
  env:
    PIXI_CACHE_DIR: "~/.cache/pixi"
    MY_VAR: "value"

my-app-path_append:
  path_append:
    - "~/.pixi/bin"
    - "~/.local/bin"
```

`~` and `$HOME` expand to the resolved home directory at generation time. Setting `PATH` directly in `env` is a validation error — use `path_append`. Later candies override earlier for the same key.

**`env:` vs `var:`:** `env:` is container **runtime** environment (emitted as `ENV` and persists into the running container). `var:` is **build-time** substitution for `${VAR}` references inside the candy's `run:`/`check:` steps — also emitted as `ENV` so BuildKit can substitute in COPY paths, but conceptually scoped to the candy's install. There's no hard rule against using `env:` for both purposes, but keeping them separate makes intent clearer.

**`env:` is a MAP, not a list.** The YAML parser decodes it as `map[string]string`, not `[]string`. Authoring it as `- KEY=value` fails with `cannot unmarshal !!seq into map[string]string` at `charly box validate`. Always use map form:

```yaml
# ❌ WRONG — parser rejects the list shape
my-app-env:
  env:
    - CHARLY_PROJECT_DIR=/workspace
    - GOPATH=~/go

# ✓ RIGHT — map form
my-app-env:
  env:
    CHARLY_PROJECT_DIR: "/workspace"
    GOPATH: "~/go"
```

The `charly-mcp` candy is the canonical example of the map form used to thread a container-level env var into the MCP server process via supervisord.

---

## Service Declaration — unified `service:` schema

A candy declares services via the **unified `service:` list**. One schema covers both distro-packaged systemd units and fully custom entries, rendered to supervisord INI (for container init) or systemd unit files (for bootc images + host deploys) by the init-system's `service_schema` in the embedded build vocabulary.

Every entry has one `name:` plus either a `use_packaged:` reference (reuse a distro-shipped unit) OR a structured custom spec (`exec`, `env`, `restart`, ...). The two forms are mutually exclusive.

### Form 1 — reuse a packaged systemd unit

For services shipped by a distro package (postgresql, nginx, redis, sshd, ...). charly enables the packaged unit with optional drop-in overrides — it never regenerates the unit file. The packaged unit at `/usr/lib/systemd/system/<unit>.service` stays untouched; override config lands at `/etc/systemd/system/<unit>.service.d/charly-<layer>.conf`.

```yaml
postgresql-service:
  service:
    - name: postgresql
      use_packaged: postgresql.service     # distro-shipped unit
      enable: true                          # systemctl enable --now
      scope: system                         # system | user
      overrides:                            # optional — rendered as drop-in
        env:
          PGDATA: /var/lib/postgresql/data
        after: [network-online.target]
```

**Supervisord caveat**: `use_packaged:` is a systemd-only concept. On supervisord-targeted images (containers using the default init), packaged entries render a warning and get skipped; either author a custom entry (form 2) or target a systemd image.

### Form 2 — custom service

For services that aren't distro-packaged (ollama, custom daemons, candy-provided binaries). charly renders the spec through the init-system's `service_template` in the embedded build vocabulary — supervisord-init containers get INI fragments, systemd-init containers and bootc/host deploys get `.service` unit files.

```yaml
ollama-service:
  service:
    - name: ollama
      exec: /usr/bin/ollama serve
      env:
        OLLAMA_HOST: "0.0.0.0:11434"
        OLLAMA_KEEP_ALIVE: "-1"
      restart: always                       # no | on-failure | always | unless-stopped
      working_directory: /var/lib/ollama
      user: ollama
      after: [network.target]
      before: [ollama-exporter]
      stdout: journal                       # journal | file:<path> | none
      stop_timeout: "30s"
      scope: system                         # system | user
      enable: true
```

### Mixed entries in one candy

A candy can declare multiple entries mixing both forms. The `sshd` candy is the canonical example: it enables the packaged `sshd.service` for systemd-init scope AND runs a custom wrapper via supervisord.

```yaml
sshd-service:
  service:
    - name: sshd
      use_packaged: sshd.service           # bootc/systemd scope
      enable: true
      scope: system

    - name: sshd                            # name may repeat across forms (different init system renders each)
      exec: /usr/local/bin/sshd-wrapper
      restart: always
      priority: 3
      enable: true
      scope: system
```

### Field reference

| Field | Required | Applies to | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `name` | yes | both | Service identifier; passed to `service_template` as `.Name` |
| `use_packaged` | form 1 | packaged | Distro-shipped unit name (e.g., `postgresql.service`); mutually exclusive with `exec` |
| `exec` | form 2 | custom | Command to run (`ExecStart` in systemd, `command` in supervisord) |
| `distro` | no | both | List of distros this entry renders on — a bare name (`debian`) or a versioned tag (`debian:13`). Empty/absent = every distro (the default). The service analogue of a check step's `exclude_distros:` — it scopes an entry to the distros whose packaging actually ships that unit/binary, so ONE candy carries per-distro-DIVERGENT daemons without a `<name>-host` sibling (R3). Filtered at render time in BOTH the build path (supervisord fragments + bootc `system_enable`) and the deploy path (`compileServiceSteps`). Canonical example: `/charly-infrastructure:virtualization` (modular `virtqemud`/`virtnetworkd` on Fedora/Arch vs monolithic `libvirtd` on Debian/Ubuntu). |
| `env` | no | both | Map of env vars; systemd renders as `Environment="K=V"`, supervisord as `environment=K="V",...` |
| `restart` | no | custom | `no` / `on-failure` / `always` / `unless-stopped`; mapped by init-specific template helper |
| `working_directory` | no | custom | `WorkingDirectory=` (systemd) / `directory=` (supervisord) |
| `user` | no | custom | Service runtime user |
| `after` | no | both | List of unit names this service starts after; systemd `After=`, supervisord priority ordering |
| `before` | no | custom | Inverse of `after` |
| `stdout` | no | custom | `journal` / `file:<path>` / `none`; init-specific mapping |
| `stop_timeout` | no | custom | `TimeoutStopSec=` (systemd) / `stopwaitsecs=` (supervisord) |
| `scope` | no | both | `system` (default, `/etc/systemd/system/`) or `user` (`~/.config/systemd/user/`) |
| `enable` | no | both | Whether to `systemctl enable --now` at install time |
| `overrides` | no | packaged | Drop-in modifications: `env`, `after`, `exec` |
| `priority` | no | supervisord-only | Startup priority; translated from `after`/`before` on systemd |

### Lifecycle-directive overlay (supervisord-only fields)

Beyond the core `service:` schema above, supervisord-rendered entries accept additional lifecycle fields: `auto_start`, `start_retries`, `start_secs`, `stop_signal`, `exit_codes`, `priority`, `kind: eventlistener` + `events:`. See `/charly-infrastructure:supervisord` for the directive table and `/charly-selkies:chrome` for the eventlistener worked example.

### Rendering to init systems

The actual unit text is rendered by the init-system's `service_schema` block in the embedded build vocabulary:

- **Supervisord init** — `service_template` produces `[program:NAME]` INI fragments with `autorestart` / `environment` / etc.; fragments go to `/etc/supervisord.d/<layer>-<name>.conf` and are assembled at container-build time.
- **Systemd init (bootc + host deploys)** — `service_template` produces `[Unit]` / `[Service]` / `[Install]` blocks; the rendered file goes to `/etc/systemd/system/charly-<layer>-<name>.service` (or the user-scope path when `scope: user`). For `use_packaged:` entries, `dropin_template` + `dropin_path_template` produce an override file alongside the packaged unit.

See `/charly-infrastructure:supervisord` for the supervisord ServiceSchemaDef template, `/charly-build:build` for the three-phase template model, and `/charly-local:local-deploy` for how the host target consumes `service:` entries.

### Worked examples in-tree

- `/charly-infrastructure:postgresql` — canonical `use_packaged:` entry with drop-in overrides
- `/charly-ollama:ollama` — single custom entry (common shape)
- `/charly-hermes:hermes` — custom entry with complex env and ordering
- `/charly-coder:sshd` — mixed (packaged + custom) within one candy
- `/charly-infrastructure:virtualization` — mixed entries + per-entry `distro:` filter: modular virtqemud/virtnetworkd on Fedora/Arch vs monolithic libvirtd on Debian/Ubuntu (canonical polymorphism example)
- `/charly-infrastructure:traefik` — multiple custom entries for a multi-service candy

### Anti-pattern: `<name>-host` / `<name>-pod` sibling candies

Do **NOT** split a polymorphic service into two candies like `myservice` (supervisord variant) + `myservice-host` (systemd variant). The mixed-entries pattern above (same `name:`, one `use_packaged:` entry, one `exec:` entry — init system at deploy time picks) is the supported way to carry both.

If you find yourself reaching for a `-host` suffix on a candy name, reach for a second `service:` entry instead. The same rule applies to `-pod` suffixes for the inverse case (a candy that needs container-only behavior under systemd targets).

`charly box validate` does NOT (yet) statically reject `*-host` / `*-pod` candy names, because some legitimate uses might exist (a candy whose package literally only exists on host distros). The rule lives in CLAUDE.md "Init-system polymorphism via mixed `service:` entries" + this skill + `/charly-infrastructure:supervisord` — agents that load any of those before authoring will see the guidance. Canonical worked examples: `/charly-coder:sshd` (mixed), `/charly-infrastructure:virtualization` (mixed; CANONICAL example), `/charly-infrastructure:postgresql` (use_packaged-only).

## Volume Declaration

```yaml
my-app-volume:
  volume:
    - name: data
      path: "~/.myapp"
```

Names must match `^[a-z0-9]+(-[a-z0-9]+)*$`. Docker/podman volume names become `charly-<image>-<name>`. Collected across the full image base chain; first declaration wins.

## Security Declaration

```yaml
my-app-security:
  security:
    privileged: false
    cap_add:
      - SYS_PTRACE
    devices:
      - /dev/dri
    security_opt:
      - label:disable
    group_add:
      - keep-groups
    mounts:
      - /dev/input:/dev/input:rw
      - tmpfs:/run/udev:rw,size=1m
    shm_size: "1g"
    memory_max: "8g"           # hard limit
    memory_high: "6g"          # soft limit
    memory_swap_max: "0"       # disable swap
    cpus: "4.0"                # CPU quota
```

Security settings merge across candies (union for lists; `privileged` true if any candy sets it; smallest-wins for resource caps). Box-level `security:` in `charly.yml` overrides `privileged` and replaces resource caps.

Resource caps (memory / cpus) bound the blast radius of a Chrome crash loop on the chrome candy. See `/charly-selkies:chrome` (Resource Caps) and `/charly-infrastructure:supervisord` for the (generic) eventlistener pattern.

---

## port_relay

Ports needing an eth0 → loopback socat relay inside the container. For services that bind only to 127.0.0.1. Auto-adds `socat` dependency and generates a relay service.

```yaml
my-app-port_relay:
  port_relay:
    - 9222
```

Note: the chrome candy uses a dedicated `cdp-proxy` supervisord service instead of `port_relay`, to handle Chrome 146+ Host header validation.

## Port Protocol Annotations

Ports support a protocol prefix that controls tunnel backend scheme and EXPOSE format:

```yaml
my-app-port:
  port:
    - 18789                   # http (default) → tailscale --https, cloudflared http://
    - "https+insecure:3000"   # https+insecure → HTTPS tunnel with self-signed OK
    - tcp:5900                # raw TCP
    - "tls-terminated-tcp:22" # tailscale TLS-terminated-tcp
    - udp:47998               # EXPOSE /udp, not tunneled
    - 9222                    # http (default)
```

Tailscale schemes: `http`, `https`, `https+insecure`, `tcp`, `tls-terminated-tcp`. Cloudflare adds `ssh`, `rdp`, `smb`. HTTPS backends (Traefik with self-signed certs) MUST use `https+insecure` — plain `http` proxying to HTTPS returns 404.

---

## secrets (image-owned)

```yaml
my-app-secret:
  secret:
    - name: api-key                # Podman secret `charly-<image>-<name>`
      target: /run/secrets/api_key # mount path (default: /run/secrets/<name>)
      env: API_KEY                 # fallback env var if Podman secrets unavailable
```

Metadata only lives in OCI labels. Values are auto-generated per instance at `charly config` time. Use for image-internal secrets (like `db-password`). For user-owned credentials (API keys, auth tokens), use `secret_accept` / `secret_require` instead.

---

## env_provide / env_require / env_accept

Cross-container environment-variable service discovery. `env_provide` is the supply side; `env_require` (mandatory) and `env_accept` (opt-in) are the demand side.

```yaml
my-app-env_provide:
  env_provide:
    OLLAMA_HOST: "http://{{.ContainerName}}:11434"
    PGHOST: "{{.ContainerName}}"
    PGPORT: "5432"

my-app-env_require:
  env_require:
    - name: DATABASE_URL
      description: "Postgres connection URL"
      default: "postgres://localhost:5432/app"

my-app-env_accept:
  env_accept:
    - name: HTTP_PROXY
      description: "Upstream HTTP proxy (optional)"
```

`{{.ContainerName}}` resolves at `charly config` time. `env_provide` values are injected only into consumers that declare matching `env_accept` or `env_require` (opt-in filtering — prevents env var leakage). Missing `env_require` without a default is a hard error at `charly config`; missing `env_accept` silently drops the var.

See `/charly-core:charly-config` (`--update-all` flag, provides filtering) and `/charly-core:deploy` (charly.yml `provides:` section) for the full lifecycle.

## secret_accept / secret_require

Credential-backed env vars. Same YAML shape as `env_accept` / `env_require`, but values flow through the credential store (keyring → config) and arrive via Podman secrets — **never plaintext in charly.yml or the quadlet**.

```yaml
my-app-secret_require:
  secret_require:
    - name: WEBUI_ADMIN_PASSWORD
      description: "Initial admin account password"

my-app-secret_accept:
  secret_accept:
    - name: OPENROUTER_API_KEY
      description: "API key for OpenRouter LLM inference"
      key: charly/api-key/openrouter     # optional override; default charly/secret/<NAME>
```

Use for API keys, passwords, auth tokens. `key:` override must match `^charly/<service>/<key>$` (lowercase). Multiple candies sharing the same upstream credential (e.g. `charly/api-key/openrouter`) all resolve to the same stored value. See `/charly-build:secrets` for the credential-store chain, rotation, and `-e NAME=VAL` auto-import.

## mcp_provide / mcp_require / mcp_accept

Cross-container MCP server discovery. Consumers receive `CHARLY_MCP_SERVERS` as a JSON env var at `charly config` time.

```yaml
my-app-mcp_provide:
  mcp_provide:
    - name: jupyter
      url: "http://{{.ContainerName}}:8888/mcp"
      transport: http                # or "sse"

my-app-mcp_accept:
  mcp_accept:
    - name: jupyter
      description: "JupyterLab CRDT MCP server for notebook manipulation"
```

**Pod-aware:** when provider and consumer share a container, URLs resolve to `localhost` (local wins over remote for same-named entries). **Naming is the service contract** — keep `name:` stable across candy/package/box renames.

**Testing the endpoint:** once a candy is deployed, `charly check live <image> --filter mcp` runs the candy's declarative `mcp:` check steps (served out-of-process by candy/plugin-mcp) — `ping` verifies the server is alive, `list-tools` enumerates the tool catalog. Both are authorable as `mcp:` `check:` steps scoped `context: [deploy]` — each its own step child node on the candy. The full verb reference (methods, URL rewriting, port-publishing gotcha, validator rules) lives in `/charly-build:charly-mcp-cmd`.

---

## data

Data candies stage files from the candy directory into volume bind-mount areas. Build-time: files COPY into `/data/<volume>/[dest/]`. Deploy-time: `charly config --bind <volume>` provisions them into bind directories; `charly update` merges non-destructively.

```yaml
my-app-volume:
  volume:
    - name: workspace
      path: "~/workspace"

my-app-data:
  data:
    - src: data/notebooks
      volume: workspace
      dest: ""                 # optional subdirectory within volume
```

**Data candies** are candies with only `data:` + `volume:` — no packages, no services, no plan steps. Valid standalone. **Data images** (`data_image: true` in charly.yml) are scratch-based — consumed via `charly config --data-from <image>`. See `/charly-jupyter:notebook-templates` for a worked example.

---

## Cache Mounts (used by the generator)

The generator attaches cache mounts automatically based on step context:

| Emission site | Cache path | Options |
|---|---|---|
| `rpm.packages` (dnf install) | `/var/cache/libdnf5` | `sharing=locked` |
| `deb.packages` (apt install) | `/var/cache/apt` + `/var/lib/apt` | `sharing=locked` |
| `pac.packages` + `aur` | `/var/cache/pacman/pkg` | `sharing=locked` |
| `command:` as root | distro-format caches (as above) + `/ctx` bind to layer stage | — |
| `command:` as non-root | `/tmp/npm-cache` (uid-scoped) + `/ctx` bind | `uid=<UID>,gid=<GID>` |
| `download:` | `/tmp/downloads` (shared across layers) | — |
| pixi builder stage | `/tmp/pixi-cache` + `/tmp/rattler-cache` | `uid=<UID>,gid=<GID>` |
| npm builder stage | `/tmp/npm-cache` | `uid=<UID>,gid=<GID>` |
| cargo inline | `/tmp/cargo-cache` | `uid=<UID>,gid=<GID>` |

UID/GID in non-root cache mounts are dynamic (from resolved image config). Flat `/tmp/<tool>-cache` paths avoid buildah permission issues with nested paths.

---

## Common Workflows

### Create a new candy

```bash
charly box new candy my-tool
# Edit candy/my-tool/charly.yml — add packages, deps, env, plan steps
charly box validate
```

### Add system packages

Add a `distro:` section to `charly.yml` keyed by distro name (`distro.fedora`, `distro.debian`, `"debian,ubuntu"` compound, `debian-13` versioned), and/or a top-level `package:` base for cross-distro names. The resolver cascades most-specific-first (packages union, repo/options most-specific-wins). `charly candy add-rpm`/`add-deb`/`add-pac`/`add-aur` append into the right `distro:` section for you.

### Add Python packages

Create `pixi.toml` in the candy directory. **`charly.yml` must depend on `python`, not `pixi`** (the `pixi` candy installs the pixi binary; the `python` candy installs Python via pixi). Never use `pip install`, `conda install`, `pixi global install`, or `uv tool install` inside a `command:` step. Always use `pixi.toml`.

**In-tree Python packages** shipped by a candy live at `candy/<layer-name>/<pkg-name>/<pkg-name>/` with `pyproject.toml` at the distribution root. Internal imports must be relative (`from .app import X`) so the package directory can be renamed without editing every `.py` file.

### Add npm packages

Create `package.json` in the candy directory; `charly.yml` depends on `nodejs`. The build system runs `npm install -g` in a multi-stage build. Do **not** put `npm install -g` inside a `command:` step — `package.json` is the declarative path.

### Add Go packages

Go has no declarative manifest for global installs, so use `command:`:

```yaml
my-go-tool:
  candy:
    version: 2026.144.1531
  my-go-tool-require:
    require:
      - golang
  my-go-tool-env:
    env:
      GOPATH: "~/go"
  my-go-tool-path_append:
    path_append:
      - "~/go/bin"
  my-go-tool-install:
    run: install the go tool globally
    command: |
      go install github.com/org/tool/cmd/tool@latest
      go clean -cache
    run_as: "${USER}"
```

For cgo dependencies, add the required `-devel` packages to `rpm:`. Always `go clean -cache` to shrink the image.

### Add a binary download

```yaml
my-tool-var:
  var:
    TOOL_VERSION: v1.2.3

my-tool-binary:
  run: install the tool release binary
  download: "https://github.com/org/tool/releases/download/${TOOL_VERSION}/tool-linux-${ARCH}.tar.gz"
  extract: tar.gz
  to: /usr/local/bin
  extract_include: [tool]
  run_as: root
```

Use `${ARCH}` (BuildKit-style) if the release URL uses `amd64`/`arm64`; use `${BUILD_ARCH}` if it uses `x86_64`/`aarch64`. If the project only ships x86_64, omit the template and hardcode — don't fake multi-arch.

### Install a wrapper script + make it the default

```yaml
local-bin-dir:
  run: create the user's local bin directory
  mkdir: "${HOME}/.local/bin"
  run_as: "${USER}"
wrapper-install:
  run: install the wrapper script
  copy: my-wrapper
  to: "${HOME}/.local/bin/my-wrapper"
  mode: "0755"
  run_as: "${USER}"
wrapper-symlink:
  run: make my-tool always go through the wrapper
  link: "${HOME}/.local/bin/my-tool"     # make my-tool always go through the wrapper
  target: my-wrapper
  run_as: "${USER}"
```

### Write a config file inline

Use `write:` — never shell heredoc:

```yaml
my-app-config:
  run: write the my-app config
  write: /etc/my-app/config.yml
  mode: "0644"
  run_as: root
  content: |
    listen: 0.0.0.0:8080
    log_level: info
    backends:
      - http://localhost:9090
```

### Add a service

Declare `service:` with a supervisord `[program:<name>]` fragment and add `supervisord` to `require:`. The generator assembles per-candy service fragments into a single `/etc/supervisord.conf` at image build time.

---

## Style Guide

- Lowercase-hyphenated names for candies.
- System packages in the `charly.yml` `distro:` map (+ top-level `package:` base) — not in `command:`.
- Python in `pixi.toml`, npm in `package.json`, Rust in `Cargo.toml`. Never `pip install` / `conda install` / `dnf install python3-*`.
- Binary downloads via `download:` verb; use `${ARCH}` or `${BUILD_ARCH}` for multi-arch URL templates.
- Never `dnf clean all` / `pacman -Scc` inside a `command:` — cache mounts handle it.
- Prefer `mkdir:` + `copy:` + `link:` + `write:` over `command:`. Fall back to `command:` only for true escape-hatch logic (git clone + cargo build, complex conditionals, etc.).
- Plan `run:` steps are order-sensitive — put `download:` / `mkdir:` before the `copy:` / `write:` / `command:` that depends on them.
- No YAML anchors: write every step explicitly (same shape for `run_as: root` and `run_as: "${USER}"`).

---

## Shell Init Surface (`shell:`)

Candies declare per-shell init snippets via the structured `shell:` field.
Same body shape as per-distro `rpm:`/`pac:`/`deb:`:
intrinsic fields apply to every shell, optional sub-blocks named after a
shell allowlist key (`bash` / `zsh` / `fish` / `sh`) override the
intrinsic for that one shell.

```yaml
# charly.yml — generic + override (the canonical shape)
direnv-shell:
  shell:
    init: |
      # Applies to bash, zsh, sh — ${SHELL_NAME} substituted at install time.
      eval "$(direnv hook ${SHELL_NAME})"
    fish:
      init: |
        # Different syntax — explicit override.
        direnv hook fish | source

# Pure per-shell form
direnv-shell:
  shell:
    bash: { init: 'eval "$(direnv hook bash)"' }
    zsh:  { init: 'eval "$(direnv hook zsh)"' }
    fish: { init: 'direnv hook fish | source' }

# PATH contributions (rendered with shell-appropriate syntax —
# fish_add_path for fish, export PATH= for bash/zsh/sh).
pixi-shell:
  shell:
    path_append:
      - "~/.pixi/bin"
```

**Selection rule** — applied per (target, shell) at install time:
1. If `shell.<shell>.init` exists, use it verbatim.
2. Otherwise, `shell.init` with `${SHELL_NAME}` substituted.
3. Otherwise, the candy contributes nothing for that shell.

**Where snippets land** — destination is target-aware:

| Shell | Container image (`charly box build`) | `target: local` host / `target: vm` guest |
|---|---|---|
| bash | `/etc/profile.d/charly-<layer>-bash.sh` | managed-block in `~/.bashrc` |
| zsh  | `/etc/profile.d/charly-<layer>-zsh.sh`  | managed-block in `~/.zshrc`  |
| sh   | `/etc/profile.d/charly-<layer>-sh.sh`   | managed-block in `~/.profile` |
| fish | `/etc/fish/conf.d/charly-<layer>.fish`  | `~/.config/fish/conf.d/charly-<layer>.fish` |

Bash/zsh/sh on host targets use a per-candy fence pair so multiple
candies coexist in one rc file:

```
# opencharly:begin <layer> (managed by charly; do not edit inside this block)
<body>
# opencharly:end <layer>
```

`charly bundle del` strips just the candy's fence pair from the rc file
(without touching unrelated content). Fish always uses a per-candy
drop-in file (`conf.d/` is auto-sourced — no fence needed).

**Cross-environment behaviour** — declaring all four shells in one
candy covers the full cartesian product `{distros} × {host shells}`.
The runtime `command -v <shell>` probe at `target: local` / `target: vm`
deploy time skips snippets for shells that aren't installed on the
target — same precedent as how `aur:` skips on non-Arch.

**Field reference (intrinsic body OR per-shell sub-block):**

| Field | Type | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `init` | string (block scalar) | Snippet body. Required when the block is present. |
| `path_append` | `[]string` | PATH entries; rendered with shell-appropriate syntax. `~/`-prefix expands at install time. |
| `path` | string | Override destination file. `..`-traversal is rejected at validate time. |
| `priority` | int | Optional load order across candies contributing to the same shell. Default 50. |

**OCI label round-trip:** the merged shell config is baked into
`ai.opencharly.shell` at `charly box build` time and parsed back via
`ExtractMetadata` at deploy. `charly.yml` `shell:` overlays merge by
id (same replace/skip/append semantics as `plan:` steps).

**Migration:** `charly migrate` rewrites legacy `command:` shell-rc
heredoc steps (matching the `# opencharly:begin direnv-hook` /
`# opencharly:begin ssh-auth-sock` fence patterns) into the structured
shell: schema. Idempotent.

## Cross-kind name reuse

A candy is a top-level **name-first** node, so within a single document the top-level node names are **globally unique**. Cross-FILE name reuse across SEPARATE discovered files IS still permitted: the same identifier (e.g. `charly-cachyos`) MAY exist as a layer at `candy/charly-cachyos/charly.yml` AND an image at `box/charly-cachyos/charly.yml` simultaneously — both are `candy:` nodes (the image carries `base:`/`from:`; there is no `box:` KIND), routed to distinct internal maps (`uf.Candy` vs `uf.Box`). Verbs disambiguate by command context. When `charly bundle add <name>` resolves a ref where both an image AND a layer with that name exist, the image wins (image-first precedence); use `--add-candy <name>` to explicitly select the layer for an overlay. See CLAUDE.md "cross-FILE cross-kind reuse is fine, but a single document's top-level node names are GLOBALLY UNIQUE" and `/charly-core:deploy`.

---

## When to Use This Skill

**MUST be invoked** for any work involving candy authoring, `charly.yml`, plan steps, `var:`, `pixi.toml`, `package.json`, `Cargo.toml`, or any file under `candy/`. Invoke this skill BEFORE reading source code or launching Explore agents.

**Workflow position:** Pre-build. Author candies before adding them to boxes. See `/charly-image:image` (composition), `/charly-build:build` (building), `/charly-build:generate` (emission internals).
