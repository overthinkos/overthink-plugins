# Layer: selkies

Browser-accessible desktop streaming via WebSocket using pixelflux (Wayland capture) and pcmflux (audio), served over HTTPS via Traefik with a self-signed certificate.

## Architecture

Selkies acts as a **nested Wayland compositor** via pixelflux. It creates `wayland-1`, and labwc (the desktop compositor) renders into it. Pixelflux captures the output and streams it to the browser via WebSocket. Traefik terminates TLS and proxies both the static web UI and WebSocket traffic.

```
Browser → Traefik (:3000 HTTPS, self-signed cert)
               ├── / → selkies-fileserver (:3001, static web UI)
               └── /websockets → Selkies Python (:8081)
                                    ├── pixelflux: Wayland capture → H.264
                                    ├── pcmflux: PulseAudio → Opus audio
                                    ├── xkbcommon: keyboard/mouse → Wayland inject
                                    └── capture bridge → /tmp/ov-capture.sock
                                          ↓
                               labwc (wayland-0, nested in pixelflux wayland-1)
```

HTTPS is required because the Selkies web UI uses the WebCodecs API (`VideoDecoder`), which requires a secure context.

### Capture Bridge

The `selkies-capture-server` runs **inside the selkies process** as a background thread, started by `selkies-wrapper` before selkies main(). It dynamically switches between **controller** mode (starts the capture pipeline when no browser is connected) and **viewer** mode (passively receives broadcast frames alongside a browser).

This is the ONLY working capture path for screenshots and recording on selkies-desktop. The pixelflux Rust backend only supports one active `ScreenCapture` at a time, and grim doesn't work because labwc can't deliver wlr-screencopy frames when nested.

**Mode switching:**
- Starts as controller → sends SETTINGS + START_VIDEO → pipeline runs
- Browser connects → server sends KILL → bridge reconnects as viewer → receives broadcast frames
- Browser disconnects → PIPELINE_RESETTING or empty buffer → reconnects as controller
- Screenshot handler can request reconnect if no valid H.264 frames (self-healing)

**H.264 frame filtering:** The selkies server broadcasts both H.264 video (`0x04` prefix + 10-byte header) and Opus audio (`0x01 0x00` prefix) as binary WebSocket messages. The bridge filters by prefix, only buffering H.264 video frames and stripping the 10-byte selkies header before storing. Audio for recording is captured separately via PulseAudio.

**Protocol on `/tmp/ov-capture.sock`:**
- `SCREENSHOT\n` → 4-byte length + PNG data (or 0 + reason string on failure)
- `STREAM\n` → continuous (4-byte length + raw H.264 frame data)
- `STATUS\n` → 4-byte length + JSON status (`connected`, `mode`, `frames`, `seq`, `active_streams`, `last_error`)

## Installation

Selkies is installed from `selkies-project/selkies` commit `af1a1c2` (not the PyPI `selkies` package, which is the old GStreamer-based upstream). The LSIO fork declares `pixelflux` and `pcmflux` as direct dependencies. `av` and `cryptography` deps are stripped before install (not needed for websocket mode).

Build-time dependencies (gcc, nodejs, npm, python3-devel, libxkbcommon-devel) are handled in the pixi builder stage via `build.sh` — they never appear in the final image. The web UI dashboard is built in the same builder stage.

## Dependencies

- `supervisord`, `python`, `pipewire`

## Ports

| Port | Protocol | Service |
|------|----------|---------|
| 3000 | HTTPS | Traefik (web UI + WebSocket proxy, self-signed cert) |
| 8081 | WebSocket | Selkies streaming backend (internal only) |

## Environment

| Variable | Value | Purpose |
|----------|-------|---------|
| `PIXELFLUX_WAYLAND` | `true` | Enable Wayland capture mode |
| `DRINODE` | `/dev/dri/renderD129` | GPU render node for pixelflux GL renderer |
| `DRI_NODE` | `/dev/dri/renderD129` | GPU render node for VAAPI encoding |
| `PULSE_SERVER` | `unix:/tmp/pulse/native` | PipeWire PulseAudio socket |

## Services (supervisord)

| Service | Priority | Purpose |
|---------|----------|---------|
| `selkies` | 8 | Streaming server (creates pixelflux wayland-1) |
| `traefik` | 18 | HTTPS reverse proxy on port 3000 (self-signed cert) |
| `selkies-fileserver` | 19 | Python static file server for web UI (port 3001, internal) |

- `selkies-wrapper` — GPU detection, PulseAudio null sink setup, NVRTC library path, starts selkies via capture server
- `selkies-capture-server` — WebSocket→Unix socket bridge with controller/viewer mode switching, H.264 frame filtering, self-healing screenshots, STATUS command
- `selkies-fileserver` — Python SPA file server with index.html fallback (serves `/usr/local/share/selkies/web/`)
- `traefik.yml` — Traefik static config (HTTPS entrypoint on :3000, self-signed cert)
- `traefik-dynamic.yml` — Path-based routing (`/websockets` → :8081, `/` → :3001) with TLS default certificate
- `build.sh` — Pixi builder stage script: pip installs selkies (C extensions), builds web UI dashboard (npm), stages artifacts for copy to final image
- `root.yml` — Downloads Traefik binary, generates self-signed cert, installs configs (no build deps, no dnf remove)
- `pixi.toml` — Python 3.13 + pip + setuptools + libxkbcommon (C headers for builder stage)

## GPU Encoding Status

| GPU | Rendering | Encoding | Status |
|-----|-----------|----------|--------|
| NVIDIA (CDI) | GL via renderD129 | NVENC attempted but fails (pixelflux compat issue with driver 590.48) | Working GL, CPU encoding fallback |
| AMD/Intel | Mesa VA-API drivers installed | VAAPI available | Untested |
| CPU | pixman fallback | x264enc / x264enc-striped / jpeg | Working |

**NVENC note:** pixelflux detects the GPU, CUDA initializes, but NVENC encoder init fails. All NVIDIA libraries load correctly (libnvidia-encode, libcuda, libnvrtc). Likely a pixelflux compatibility issue with driver 590.48. CPU x264enc at 60fps with striped mode (16 parallel stripes) provides good performance.

**Important:** Setting `SELKIES_ENCODER=x264enc-striped` locks to CPU mode. Leave encoder unset for GPU auto-detection.
