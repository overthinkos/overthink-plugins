# go-quality — checking & fixing charly Go source for CLAUDE.md compliance

The `charly/` CLI is one large `package main` (~570 files, ~169K LOC). This skill is the
operational HOW for auditing it against the checkable subset of CLAUDE.md and driving the
fixes. It owns the *tooling + method*; the rule definitions live in `/charly-internals:strict-policy`
(R1–R5), the source map in `/charly-internals:go`, and landing in `/charly-internals:cutover-policy`
+ `/charly-internals:git-workflow`.

## Toolchain (all declared in the `dev-tools` candy)

| Tool | Role | Invocation (from `charly/`, where `go.mod` lives) |
|---|---|---|
| `golangci-lint` v2 | the deterministic backbone — bundles staticcheck/unused/errcheck/ineffassign/dupl/gocritic/misspell/revive/gocyclo/… | `golangci-lint run ./...` |
| `gopls` | references / call-sites / rename — confirm a symbol is truly unused before deleting | `gopls references`, `gopls call_hierarchy` |
| `go vet` | compiler-adjacent correctness | `go vet ./...` |
| `gofmt` | formatting drift | `gofmt -l .` |
| `go test ./...` | unit smoke (NOT the R10 gate) | `go test ./...` |

`golangci-lint` is **v2** — the config schema is `version: "2"` (not v1). `dupl` is a BUNDLED
linter, NOT a standalone tool (it is absent from the AUR — do not try to install it). There is
no `deadcode`/`staticcheck`/`misspell` standalone install either; all are bundled. No
`go install` of any linter (that would be an R4 workaround).

## The config — `charly/.golangci.yml`

Lives next to `charly/go.mod` (the module root), NOT the repo root. It enables the standard
set + the broadest curated quality/idiom/duplication linters, uncapped (`max-issues-per-linter:
0`) so an audit sees EVERY issue. **`gosec` is deliberately excluded**: on a subprocess-
orchestrating CLI its findings are dominated by the legitimate `exec.Command` pattern (the exact
false-positive class below); vulnerability scanning is `govulncheck`'s separate job.

## Running the audit

```bash
cd charly
golangci-lint run ./...                 # full broadest run (uncapped)
golangci-lint run ./... | grep -E '^\* '   # per-linter summary counts
gofmt -l .                              # files needing format
go vet ./...
```

Baseline at authoring (2026-06, broadest uncapped): **1017 issues** — errcheck 457,
staticcheck 242, unparam 100, unused 53, gocyclo 46, gocritic 43, errorlint 29, prealloc 29,
dupl 10, ineffassign 4, unconvert 3, misspell 1. Re-run to refresh; the per-linter shape is the
triage map.

**MEASUREMENT GOTCHA — measure with the configured run, NEVER `--enable-only`.** The
authoritative count is `golangci-lint run ./...` (the configured set), which DEDUPLICATES
across linters: a function flagged `unused` is NOT also reported by `unparam` for its params,
and a complex function shows ONCE (e.g. as `gocyclo`). `golangci-lint run --enable-only unparam`
DISABLES that dedup and surfaces "phantom" hits the configured run attributes elsewhere — so a
category can read 3 under `--enable-only` and 0 in the real gate. Always trust the configured
run; it is what CI and contributors see. (Corollary under "Fixing": a `//nolint` can shift which
linter "wins" the dedup — see there.)

## Auto-fix safety — NEVER blanket `--fix` (CRITICAL)

**`golangci-lint run --fix` CORRUPTS this source tree** (confirmed 2026-06-14, v2.12.2):
gocritic's autofixer rewrites multi-statement blocks into a one-liner whose body it emits as a
literal `{ ... }` elision placeholder — the `...` is gocritic's snip marker, written verbatim
into the file → `syntax error: unexpected ...` (broke `ssh_client.go` + `deploy_executor_nested.go`,
`go build` failed). Recovery: `git checkout -- charly/` then `go build ./...`.

- **`gofmt -w .` is the ONLY safe blanket auto-fix** (pure formatting, AST-identical).
- Fix every linter category **manually / per-finding with review**, or `--fix` scoped to a
  SINGLE proven-safe linter at a time — NEVER gocritic. golangci-lint is for *finding*, not
  auto-*fixing*. (Memory: [[golangci-lint-fix-corrupts-source]].)

## gopls `modernize` — the Go 1.26 idiom set (auto-fix IS safe, with a compile gate)

The modernize idioms (`interface{}`→`any`, `strings.Cut`, `slices.Contains`, `maps.Copy`,
`CutPrefix`/`CutSuffix`, range-over-int, `slices.Backward`, `WaitGroup.Go`, `slices.Sort`,
`errors.AsType`, `new(expr)`) are NOT in the golangci-lint backbone — they are gopls analyzers.
Run + fix tree-wide from `charly/`:

```bash
go run golang.org/x/tools/gopls/internal/analysis/modernize/cmd/modernize@latest ./...        # findings (STDERR, not stdout)
go run golang.org/x/tools/gopls/internal/analysis/modernize/cmd/modernize@latest -fix ./...    # apply (re-run; overlapping fixes need >1 pass)
```

Unlike gocritic's `--fix`, the OFFICIAL modernize `-fix` is SAFE — but still gate it on `go build`:
- Findings print to **STDERR** (redirect `2>file`, not `>file`).
- It applies in passes ("applied N of M; re-run to apply more") — re-run until 0.
- Disable a risky category with `-<name>=false` (e.g. RDD a category first).
- **`omitzero`** removes the no-op `,omitempty` from **JSON tags only** (struct-typed fields),
  preserving the yaml tag — behavior-neutral; it explicitly SKIPS the behavior-CHANGING
  `omitempty`→`omitzero` alternative. Safe to apply.
- **`newexpr`** rewrites `boolPtr(x)`/`intPtr(x)`/`ptrBool(x)` call sites to `new(x)` but does
  NOT touch test-file calls or delete the now-dead wrapper helpers → CASCADE: after `-fix`, the
  wrappers are `unused` (delete them) and any remaining test calls must be rewritten too;
  `uintPtr(0)`→`new(uint)` (zero-value form — modernize can't infer the type). Needs `go 1.26`
  in go.mod. The `errorsastype` fix can leave a dangling bound var (`if x, ok := …AsType[…]`
  where the body never uses `x`) → `go build` catches it; change to `_, ok`.

## Dead-code (`unused`) — legitimate-keep patterns (do NOT delete)

golangci-lint `unused` is reliable for `package main`, but some flagged symbols are
intentionally retained — deleting them is wrong. Flag (don't delete) a symbol that:
- carries an explicit **retention doc-comment** ("kept for …", "retained because …");
- is referenced by a closure that is itself assigned-but-not-called (`check := func(){…}; _ = check`)
  — deleting the symbol breaks `go build` even though `unused` flags it;
- is named only in **comments / cross-references** (incl. comments in OTHER files / tests) —
  deleting orphans the reference;
- is deliberately-unwired scaffolding for a not-yet-shipped path.
Always confirm with `go build ./...` + `go test ./...` after deletions: a deletion that breaks
either means the symbol WAS used (transitively) — restore + flag it. A stale retention comment
whose named consumer no longer exists is its own R1 incident (fix the comment, then re-evaluate).

**RCA each dead symbol — removable vs missing-caller bug.** An unused exported symbol the
`unused` linter CANNOT see (it skips exported) is found by grepping call sites repo-wide; an
unused UNEXPORTED one may be a *latent bug* (a caller accidentally dropped) rather than obsolete
code. To find WHEN/WHY a symbol lost its caller, use the pickaxe — but **`git log -S 'sym(' --
charly/` is a TRAP**: a directory rename (the historical `ov/`→`charly/` move) makes EVERY
symbol's token count go 0→N under the new path, so the rename masquerades as the add/remove
commit. Run `git log --all -S 'sym('` WITHOUT the pathspec to find the true caller-removal
commit, then read its message: a deliberate relocation ("behavior moved to X") → delete the
orphan; an accidental drop → it may be a bug to re-wire (escalate if the disposition is a design
call). Verdict A (genuinely dead) only after the behavior is confirmed relocated or never-built.

## The `.go` compliance checklist

**Linter-covered (deterministic — let golangci-lint find these, agents only triage + dedup):**
dead code/`unused`, `ineffassign`, `unconvert`, `staticcheck` correctness, `gocritic` idiom,
`misspell`, `gocyclo` complexity, `errcheck` unchecked errors, `errorlint` wrapping, `unparam`,
`prealloc`, and `dupl` cross-file/in-file duplication (R3).

**Agent-only (linters cannot express — grep + judgment):**
- **R4 workarounds**: `time.Sleep` poll/retry loops lacking a sync primitive; unnamed magic
  numbers/durations; retry-on-flake; environment-specific shims; ad-hoc
  `podman`/`docker`/`virsh`/`systemctl` that BYPASS charly (see allowlist for the legitimate ones).
- **R5 stale paths**: `deprecated`/`DEPRECATED`/`TODO` markers with un-swept old code paths;
  references to deleted identifiers (grep the identifier — only `CHANGELOG/` should remain).
- **Repo invariants**: YAML-tag ↔ Go-identifier plural/singular symmetry; mode purity
  (`LoadConfig` must NOT read the deploy overlay / `charly.yml`); InstallPlan IR sync points;
  the "charly CLI is the only operational interface" rule.

## Legitimate-pattern allowlist — do NOT flag these (the #1 noise source)

- `exec.Command("podman"|"virsh"|"systemctl"|"pacman"…)` where **charly IS the orchestrator**
  — these are the operational interface, not ad-hoc bypasses. Forbidden is an ad-hoc such call
  against a charly-managed resource OUTSIDE the orchestration path.
- Idiomatic `errcheck` ignores: `defer x.Close()`, `fmt.Fprint*` to stderr/stdout, `os.Setenv`
  in tests — the fix is an explicit `_ = …` (makes intent visible), not handling.
- Named, justified `time.Sleep` polls in device/container/mount liveness (adb, gocryptfs) where
  no event/sync primitive is exposed by the underlying tool.
- Standard mode bits (`0o755`/`0o644`/`0o600`), well-known ports/IDs documented in domain code.

## Triage + adversarial verification (mandatory before any fix)

False positives auto-"fixed" become regressions. Every candidate finding is **adversarially
verified** — ≥3 skeptics, each prompted to REFUTE with a distinct lens (coincidence-not-dup /
legitimate-orchestration / no-sync-primitive-exists / idiomatic-ignore / would-break-surrounding-
idiom), **defaulting to refuted when uncertain**. Only majority-confirmed findings are fixed.

## Fixing — a handful of large thematic cutovers (NOT per-finding)

Group ALL confirmed findings into ~8 large cutovers, each fixing a whole homogeneous category
(tens-to-hundreds) as ONE atomic commit, R10-gated as a whole. Order low-risk/high-value →
higher-churn: dead-code → dupl(R3) → staticcheck → errcheck → idiom/quality → gocyclo →
agent-only rules. Cutovers land SEQUENTIALLY (one Go package — no concurrent mega-edits); the
EDITS within a cutover parallelize by file-cluster.

**`gocyclo` is a HEURISTIC — triage refactor-vs-nolint by SHAPE, never blanket-extract.**
Cyclomatic complexity scores a 60-case config `switch` identically to deeply-nested branching,
but the switch is trivially readable and extracting it just relocates the cases. So per function:
- **REFACTOR** a *sequential phase orchestrator / emitter* (a build pipeline, a Containerfile
  generator, an R10-sequence runner) — extract each cohesive phase into a named helper in the
  SAME file (behavior-preserving; byte-identical output for emitters). Genuinely clarifies.
- **`//nolint:gocyclo // <reason>`** a *flat cohesive* function — a config-key switch, a verb-set
  enumeration, a protocol decoder/state-machine, a sequential peer-validator, a diagnostic
  narrative — where artificial extraction HARMS readability. Each nolint carries a specific reason.
- When in doubt, nolint (zero-risk) over a risky extraction; a huge function (139) that can't
  reach the threshold by extraction alone gets the major phases extracted AND a residual nolint.

**`//nolint` shifts the cross-linter dedup — watch for unmasked findings (R2).** Adding
`//nolint:gocyclo` to a function that was ALSO (silently) an `unparam`/`unusedparams` hit removes
the gocyclo report, so the configured run now surfaces the previously-deduped finding. Resolve
the unmasked finding in the SAME cutover (e.g. remove an always-constant param, or `//nolint:
unparam` a uniform-handler signature) — don't nolint-stack blindly.

## R10 gate by change class (the commit gate)

`go test ./...` + `golangci-lint run` + `task build:charly` are SMOKE, not the gate. The gate
is `charly check run <bed>` on the bed that EXERCISES the change (cross-cutting tree-wide
categories → fan EVERY matching bed out concurrently via `/verify-beds`, one `charly check run <bed>` per agent), disposable-only, fresh-rebuild, zero warnings, pasted proof. See
`/charly-check:check` "R10 gate by change class" and `/charly-internals:cutover-policy`.

## Cross-References

- `/charly-internals:strict-policy` — R1–R5, RDD, the forbidden-pattern catalogs (the WHAT).
- `/charly-internals:go` — the Go source map (file → responsibility).
- `/charly-internals:skills` — the companion **skill↔code source-map sync audit** (docs side).
- `/charly-internals:cutover-policy` + `/charly-internals:git-workflow` — landing the fixes.
- `/charly-check:check` — the R10 bed gate every code cutover passes.

## When to Use This Skill

Invoke before running golangci-lint / dupl / a duplication check, auditing charly Go source
for CLAUDE.md compliance or code quality, or planning/landing a compliance fix sweep.
