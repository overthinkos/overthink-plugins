# vm-deploy-target

## The `vm` substrate is external (out-of-process)

`vm` is one of the EXTERNAL deploy substrates (`externalizedDeploySubstrates`
in `charly/provider_deploy.go`, alongside `local`/`android`/`k8s`). There is
no in-proc VM deploy target: the plan WALK runs OUT-OF-PROCESS in
`candy/plugin-deploy-vm` (serving the `deploy:vm` word) — a near-clone of
`candy/plugin-deploy-local`. The plugin receives the deployment's `InstallPlan`
VIEWS over the executor reverse channel and walks them via the shared
`charly/plugin/kit.WalkPlans` — the SAME walk `deploy:local` uses. The
difference is purely the executor's TRANSPORT: the executor the reverse channel
serves for a vm deploy is the **guest `SSHExecutor`**, so the SAME `kit.WalkPlans`
that runs a local deploy on the host runs a vm deploy **inside the guest** over SSH.

Step routing inside the walk (`kit.WalkPlans`):

- **Plugin-renderable steps** — `Op` (write/cmd/download), `File`, `ShellHook`
  (+ the env.d managed-block finalizer `ensureVenueManagedBlock`),
  `ShellSnippet`, `ServicePackaged`, `ServiceCustom`, `RepoChange` — the plugin
  executes ITSELF via the F2 reverse legs (`RunSystem` / `RunUser` / `PutFile` /
  `GetFile`), ECHOING the host-computed `view.ReverseOps`.
- **Host-engine steps** — `Builder` / `LocalPkgInstall` / `SystemPackages` /
  act-verb `Op` / `ExternalPlugin` — the plugin drives over `RunHostStep`
  (host-side: builders run on the host's podman, artifacts scp into the guest).
- **`RebootStep`** (a `reboot: true` kernel-module layer) — also driven over
  `RunHostStep`, where the HOST reboots the guest and waits for the
  deterministic boot_id change.

Because `{{.Home}}` is resolved against the GUEST home host-side (the served
executor's `ResolveHome` targets the guest), the plugin ships no substrate
payload. It returns a `DeployReply` carrying the combined teardown ops the host
records in the install ledger and replays at `charly bundle del`
(record-and-replay).

## `externalDeployTarget` — the generic adapter

`externalDeployTarget` (`charly/deploy_target_external.go`) is the generic
out-of-process adapter. In-proc, two targets implement the bare
`DeployTarget` (Name + Emit) interface — `OCITarget` (pod-overlay `add_candy:`
Containerfile synthesis; `charly box build`/`generate` itself uses the separate
`writeCandySteps` → `emitTasks` generator) and `PodDeployTarget` (the pod
overlay-BUILD engine) — but both are now BUILD ENGINES invoked HOST-SIDE from a
lifecycle hook (`podSubstrateLifecycle.PrepareVenue`), NOT deploy targets
dispatched by `ResolveTarget`. The deploy LIFECYCLE is the separate
`UnifiedDeployTarget` interface (Add/Del/Test/Update/Start/…/Rebuild), and its
sole implementer is the generic `externalDeployTarget`. **ALL FIVE external
substrates (`local`/`vm`/`pod`/`k8s`/`android`) route through
`externalDeployTarget`** over the executor reverse channel, each served by its
own out-of-process plugin.
`externalDeployTarget.Add` Invokes the
provider (`OpExecute`) with the deployment's `InstallPlan` views in `op.Params`
and a venue descriptor in `op.Env`, serving the host's executor on the go-plugin
broker so the plugin runs the deployment's shell/SSH ops on the real venue;
`Del` replays the RECORDED `ReverseOps` from the ledger (no plugin call). See
`/charly-internals:install-plan` for the shared IR.

## `vmSubstrateLifecycle` — the host-side VM venue lifecycle hook

Unlike `local`/`android`/`k8s` (which register NO lifecycle hook — their venue
has no charly-owned lifecycle), `vm` owns a real venue lifecycle: charly boots /
destroys / consoles / SSHes the domain, and `charly update <vm-bed>` MUST
destroy+build+create+start+re-add the domain (the R10 fresh-rebuild gate). That
host-only work lives behind a registered hook:

- `vmSubstrateLifecycle` (`charly/vm_deploy_lifecycle.go`) implements the
  `substrateLifecycle` interface (`charly/deploy_substrate_lifecycle.go`),
  registered via `registerSubstrateLifecycle("vm", …)` at package-var init.
- `externalDeployTarget` consults the registry by substrate word — it never
  branches on `"vm"` directly, only on whether a hook is registered. `vm` is
  the only substrate that registers one today (pod's lifecycle joins this seam
  when pod externalizes).

The hook provides:

| Method | What it does |
|---|---|
| `PrepareVenue` | The full host-side preflight, run BEFORE the plugin walks: resolve the `kind:vm` entity, write the managed ssh-config Host stanza (+ ensure the Include line), auto-boot the domain (`autoBootVmIfNeeded`), `WaitForSSH` / `WaitForCloudInit` / `WaitForPackageLock`, `EnsureCharlyInGuest`, build + return the guest `SSHExecutor` the reverse channel serves, and persist `VmDeployState`. |
| `ArtifactKey` | Keys candy artifacts (+ the k3s `ClusterProfile`) under `vm:<entity>`, NOT the deploy name — one k3s cluster per VM is reached by several beds, so its profile lands under the shared `vm-<entity>` name the `cluster:` refs use. |
| `PostApply` | Deploys nested `target: pod` children as persistent in-guest quadlets (`deployNestedPodsInGuest`), AFTER the walk (so the VM's own candies + any kernel-driver reboot are already applied). Add only; skipped under `--node-only`. |
| `TeardownExecutor` | Returns the guest `SSHExecutor` (against the managed alias, no boot) the recorded `ReverseOps` replay over IN THE GUEST. |
| `PostTeardown` | Host cleanup after teardown: `RemoveVmSshStanza` + `removeVmDeployEntry` + ephemeral lifecycle teardown. |
| `Start` / `Stop` / `Status` / `Logs` / `Shell` / `Rebuild` | Shell to the `charly vm` family. `Rebuild` does `charly vm destroy` + `build` + `create` + `start` + `charly bundle add <name>` (re-applying the deploy's candies to the fresh guest via the shared layer-apply primitive, R3) — the path `charly update <vm-bed>` routes through. |

`PrepareVenue` LIFTS the prior in-proc preflight: resolve entity + ssh-config
stanza + auto-boot, plus `WaitForSSH` / `WaitForCloudInit` / `WaitForPackageLock`
/ `EnsureCharlyInGuest`, into one host-side step that runs before the plugin walks.

## Implementation notes

- The `pod` substrate is EXTERNAL (`deploy:pod`, candy/plugin-deploy-pod); `PodDeployTarget` (`charly/deploy_target_pod.go`) is its RETAINED overlay-BUILD engine, invoked HOST-SIDE from `podSubstrateLifecycle.PrepareVenue` (`charly/pod_deploy_lifecycle.go`). Its teardown record is keyed HOST-SIDE by `computeDeployID(name)` like every external deploy (the in-proc pod was record-free).
- `vmNameFromDeployName` strips the `vm:` prefix. `vmEntityForAdd` / `vmEntityForLifecycle` resolve the `kind:vm` entity from a deploy node: the node's `vm:` cross-ref (`node.From`) wins, then the persisted cross-ref, then a legacy `vm:<entity>` prefix, then the deploy name itself.
- `UnifiedDeployTarget` / `LifecycleTarget` interfaces (`charly/deploy_target_unified.go`) + the `ResolveTarget` dispatcher (`charly/unified_targets.go`) provide the full lifecycle contract (`Add` / `Del` / `Test` / `Update` / `Start` / `Stop` / `Status` / `Logs` / `Shell` / `Rebuild`). `ResolveTarget` returns an `externalDeployTarget` for every externalized substrate (local/vm/pod/k8s/android — all five).
- Disposability is read per-`BundleNode` via `charly/deploy.go::BundleNode.IsDisposable()` (`disposable: true`, or ephemeral); it is NOT a `VmSpec` field. The disposability-as-authorization gate is NOT applied in the `charly update` path — `charly update <vm>` rebuilds on explicit invocation regardless (it only NOTES non-disposability, never refuses). `externalDeployTarget.Rebuild` delegates to the `vmSubstrateLifecycle.Rebuild` hook, which recreates the domain THEN re-applies the deploy node's layers via the shared `charly bundle add <node>` path — the same layer-apply primitive the local/pod Rebuild use (R3).

The `vm` substrate brings `charly bundle add vm:<name>` online: the same
`InstallPlan` IR that drives pod builds and host deploys runs **inside a VM**
over SSH. Shell bodies that a `local:` deploy would exec via local `sudo bash -s`
are instead exec'd via `ssh guest 'sudo bash -s'` through the guest
`SSHExecutor`. The teardown ledger is keyed HOST-SIDE by
`computeDeployID(deployName)` (like every external deploy); teardown replays the
recorded `ReverseOps` over the guest SSH executor (an `sshReverseRunner` derived
from the executor), so the reverse ops run IN THE GUEST.

## DeployExecutor interface

```go
type DeployExecutor interface {
    RunShell(ctx context.Context, script string, opts ShellOpts) (ExecResult, error)
    Scp(ctx context.Context, src io.Reader, dst string, mode os.FileMode) error
    Close() error
}
```

Two implementations:

- `ShellExecutor` — `bash -c <script>` / file copy. Used host-side for container-builder invocations (the `RunHostStep` leg) and by the dry-run path of any target.
- `SSHExecutor` — ssh/scp via `golang.org/x/crypto/ssh`. Used for the `vm` substrate (the guest executor the reverse channel serves) and for a `local: {host: user@machine}` remote. Carries Host/Port/User/KeyPath + maintains a persistent connection across multiple shell invocations.

**Name choice**: the interface is `DeployExecutor` — a deploy-scoped name kept distinct from the check runner's own execution types.

## PrepareVenue preflight flow

`vmSubstrateLifecycle.PrepareVenue` runs the host-side preflight BEFORE the
plugin walks the plans:

1. **Resolve the `kind:vm` entity** from the deploy node (`vmEntityForAdd`) + load the `VmSpec` from `charly.yml`.
2. **Publish the managed ssh-config stanza** (`WriteVmSshStanza`) for the VM alias + `EnsureSshConfigInclude`.
3. **Auto-boot** (`autoBootVmIfNeeded`): TCP-probe the SSH port and, if unreachable, `charly vm build` + `charly vm create`. No-op in DryRun, when nested, and when `CHARLY_DEPLOY_NO_AUTOBOOT` is set.
4. **Wait for SSH.** `SSHExecutor.WaitForSSH` — polls `net.Dial` to `host:port` with exponential backoff, accommodating cold-boot VMs where cloud-init is provisioning sshd.
5. **Wait for cloud-init + package lock** (cloud_image / cloud-init sources). `WaitForCloudInit` polls `cloud-init status --wait`; `WaitForPackageLock` waits for the package manager.
6. **EnsureCharlyInGuest.** Runs the `VmCharlyInstall.Strategy` state machine (see `/charly-internals:cloud-init-renderer`).
7. **Build + return the guest `SSHExecutor`** (the reverse channel serves it to the plugin) and **persist `VmDeployState`**.

The plugin's `kit.WalkPlans` then resolves the guest home (`exec.ResolveHome`),
walks the plans inside the guest, and writes the guest ledger / env.d via the
reverse legs.

## Guest-home resolution (deploy-time `{{.Home}}`)

Home-bearing step fields — `ShellHookStep` env values + `path_append`,
`ShellSnippetStep` snippet/destination, `FileStep.Dest` — are compiled with the
deferred `{{.Home}}` token (`HomeToken`), NOT a baked compile-time home. For an
external deploy, `externalDeployTarget.prepareReverseState` resolves the token
host-side against the VENUE home (`t.exec.ResolveHome`) before projecting the
views — for `vm` the **GUEST** home, because the served executor is the guest
`SSHExecutor`. This is why a `target: vm` deploy writes
`/home/<guest-user>/.config/opencharly/env.d/<layer>.env` whose contents point
at `/home/<guest-user>/…` rather than the host operator's home. `cmd:` task
bodies are left untouched — `~`/`$HOME` there shell-expand at runtime on the
guest as the deploy user, already correct. See `/charly-internals:install-plan`
"Deferred home resolution".

## env.d-sourcing managed block (guest login shell)

The env.d-sourcing managed block is written by `kit.WalkPlans`'s finalizer
(`ensureVenueManagedBlock`) over the served (guest) executor — so for a `vm`
deploy it lands in the guest's detected login-shell init via the reverse legs
(`GetFile` the existing rc, merge the fenced block, `PutFile` it back). The
shared body/path helpers (`ManagedBlockBody`, `ShellInitFilePath`,
`replaceOrAppendManagedBlock`)
live in `charly/shell_profile.go`; the plugin renders the equivalent via
`charly/plugin/kit/profile.go`. Without this block the per-layer env.d files
exist but are never sourced, so PATH never picks up `~/.npm-global/bin` etc. The
shell is detected from the GUEST `/etc/passwd` (getent), because the guest's
interactive default may differ from the operator's (CachyOS ships fish) —
writing bash syntax to `~/.profile` when the guest runs fish would never load.

## Cross-host builders (npm / pixi / cargo / aur)

Builders run on the HOST (podman) and ship the result into the guest — guests
never need a container runtime. For a `vm` deploy the plugin drives the
`Builder` / `LocalPkgInstall` step over `RunHostStep`, so the host builds and
the artifact streams in:

- **aur** → builds `.pkg.tar.zst` in a host staging dir, scp's them in, `pacman -U`.
- **npm / pixi / cargo** → bind-mounts a host staging dir AS the **guest home path**
  so npm shebangs / cargo rpaths / pixi activation scripts bake the path the guest
  will actually use, then tars the produced home subdirs (`~/.npm-global`, `~/.pixi`,
  `~/.cargo`; caches excluded), scp's the tarball in, and extracts it into the guest
  `$HOME` **as the guest user** so ownership + baked paths are correct. The builder
  image resolves via `resolveBuilderImage`. Unknown builders honor `--skip-incompatible`.

This is what makes the full charly-cachyos stack — including the npm-builder AI CLIs
(`claude-code`, `codex`, `gemini`, `oracle`, `forgecode`) — install on a VM.

## RebootStep — only the vm deploy reboots

When a layer declares `reboot: true`, `BuildDeployPlan` appends a trailing
`RebootStep`. Only the external `vm` deploy acts on it: the plugin drives it
over `RunHostStep`, where the HOST reboots the guest (records the guest's
`/proc/sys/kernel/random/boot_id`, fires `(sleep 1; systemctl reboot) &` so the
ssh session closes cleanly, then polls until SSH answers AND the boot_id has
changed — deterministic, not a fixed sleep, so the still-up pre-reboot sshd
can't be mistaken for "back up"). OCI/pod/k8s skip it; the external `local:`
deploy skips + warns — it never reboots the operator host. This is what lets a
kernel-module layer (e.g. the CachyOS `nvidia-driver` layer) load its module on
a clean boot mid-deploy. See `/charly-internals:install-plan` RebootStep.

## Host→guest image transfer (`charly vm cp-box`)

`charly vm cp-box <vm> <ref> [--as <tag>] [--rootless]` (and the reusable
`TransferImageToGuest` helper) stream a host-built image into a running guest's
podman storage via `podman save | ssh podman load` (NO intermediate tarball —
the guest `/tmp` tmpfs is too small for a multi-GB image), idempotent (skips an
intact present image, re-streams a torn-overlay one — a name-only check would
wrongly skip a corrupt image) and offline (no registry). `--rootless` selects the
storage, and ALL of the load / integrity-probe / tag steps follow it consistently
(via the `podmanCmd(rootless)` helper):

- **default** → the guest's ROOT podman (`sudo podman`), for a `sudo podman run
  --device nvidia.com/gpu=all` consumer that needs `/dev/nvidia*` via root.
- **`--rootless`** → the SSH user's ROOTLESS podman (`podman`, no sudo; the tag
  runs via `RunUser`, not `RunSystem`). This is what `deployNestedPodsInGuest`
  uses: the nested pod comes up via the guest user's own `charly bundle from-box`
  (a `--user` quadlet) which reads the USER's storage, so the image MUST land
  there — a root-loaded image would be invisible to it.

## Nested pod-in-VM — persistent in-guest quadlet (`deployNestedPodsInGuest`)

A `target: vm` deploy whose `nested:` map has `target: pod` children brings each
child up as a PERSISTENT in-guest quadlet — the nested-pod-in-VM capability.
`vmSubstrateLifecycle.PostApply` calls `deployNestedPodsInGuest` AFTER the plan
walk (so the guest's own layers, including any kernel-driver reboot + the
boot-time `nvidia-ctk cdi generate`, are already applied). For each child it:

1. `charly box build <child.Image>` on the HOST (the guest needs no project).
2. `charly vm cp-box <vm> <child.Image> --as localhost/charly-<childKey>:latest
   --rootless` — into the guest USER's rootless podman.
3. over SSH as the guest user: `loginctl enable-linger` (so the `--user` quadlet
   auto-starts at boot and survives reboot), then `export
   XDG_RUNTIME_DIR=/run/user/$(id -u)` (so `systemctl --user` reaches the
   lingering user bus over the non-login SSH session), then the guest's own
   project-free `charly bundle from-box localhost/charly-<childKey>:latest
   <childKey>` — which generates + starts the quadlet from the image's baked OCI
   labels (ports, services, GPU device auto-detected in the guest; rootless GPU
   via CDI — `/dev/nvidia*` are world-rw and the CDI spec is world-readable).

Idempotent (cp-box skips an intact image; from-box re-applies on `charly update`).
The dispatch routes a VM-root deploy node-only (its pod children deploy in-guest
here, never via a host tree walk). `charly check live <vm>.<pod>` evaluates the
running nested pod by DELEGATING to the guest `charly check live <pod>` (where it is
a direct pod — guest-local podman + ports + the guest `charly`), so the protocol
verbs (cdp/wl/dbus/vnc/mcp) and `${HOST_PORT}` checks run natively instead of
skipping; see `/charly-check:check` "parent.child reaches the actual leaf". `charly vm
cp-box` is the host→guest image delivery for it.

## VmDeployState persistence

```go
type VmDeployState struct {
    InstanceID              string                  // stable UUIDv4 cloud-init instance-id, pinned across re-renders
    DiskPath                string                  // absolute path to the qcow2 (may be a CoW overlay on a cached base)
    SeedIso                 string                  // NoCloud cidata ISO path (empty for bootc with injection disabled)
    SshPort                 int                     // host port forwarded to the guest's :22
    SshUser                 string                  // guest account the deploy SSHes in as
    Backend                 string                  // "qemu" or "libvirt", pinned at first apply
    KeyInjectionResolved    *VmKeyInjectionResolved // resolved SSH key-injection plan
    CharlyInstallStrategy       string                  // how charly is installed into the guest
    CloudInitRenderedDigest string                  // digest of the rendered cloud-init (re-render detection)
    Snapshots               []VmSnapshotState       // libvirt snapshot ledger
    Ephemeral               *EphemeralRuntime       // transient run-state for an ephemeral VM
}
```

Persisted in `~/.config/charly/charly.yml` as the `vm_state:` field on the VM's deploy entry (`BundleNode.VmState`), written by `saveVmDeployState` in `PrepareVenue`. Each `charly vm build` / `charly vm create` / `charly bundle add vm:<name>` iteration updates the relevant fields. `charly bundle del vm:<name>` preserves the state (so re-adding picks up InstanceID etc.) unless `--purge` is passed.

## SSH key idempotency

`generateSSHKeypair` in `charly/vm.go` checks for `<vmStateDir>/id_ed25519.pub` before creating. Rebuilding a VM doesn't regenerate the keypair. First `charly vm build` writes the keypair; subsequent calls leave it untouched — so iterated rebuilds keep a stable pubkey and SSH stays valid.

## CLI dispatch: bundle add → ResolveTarget → externalDeployTarget

`charly bundle add vm:<name>` resolves via `bundle_add_cmd.go::dispatchNode` →
`ResolveTarget` → `externalDeployTarget` when the deploy node is a `vm:`
substrate (or the deploy name starts with `vm:`). `externalDeployTarget.Add`
runs the `vmSubstrateLifecycle.PrepareVenue` preflight (boot + guest executor),
then Invokes `deploy:vm` to walk the plans inside the guest:

```
charly bundle add vm:arch ripgrep           # apply ripgrep layer in the guest
charly bundle add vm:arch fedora-coder \    # apply full fedora-coder layer set
    --add-candy team-extras \
    --add-candy github.com/team/configs/candy/sshkeys
charly bundle del vm:arch                   # reverse all applied layers in the guest
```

Prereq: the VM is auto-booted by `PrepareVenue` if not already reachable
(`charly vm build` + `charly vm create`), or you can create it explicitly first
(`charly vm create arch`).

## passt backend + SSH port forwarding

When the VM's network uses libvirt user-mode + `<backend type='passt'/>` + `<portForward>` (see `/charly-internals:libvirt-renderer`), the guest `SSHExecutor` connects to `127.0.0.1:<host-port>`. The portForward maps that through passt into the guest's `:22`. The indirection is invisible to `SSHExecutor` — it sees a normal TCP connect.
