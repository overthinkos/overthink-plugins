  Use when authoring or modifying a charly PLUGIN — a candy with a `plugin:` block that contributes
  Providers (verbs/kinds/deploy-targets/steps/builders/commands), its own CUE schema, builtin (compiled-in) or
  external (out-of-tree git repo). Covers the unified Provider model, the per-plugin CUE-schema contract
  (single source → Go params for dev + schema-over-Describe RPC for runtime), the SDK, and the loader.

# Plugins — the unified Provider + per-plugin CUE-schema model

A **plugin is a candy** (`candy/<name>/charly.yml`) carrying a `plugin:` block. The single addition that
makes a candy a plugin is that block:

```yaml
my-plugin:
  candy:
    version: 2026.180.1200          # mandatory CalVer (any candy)
    description: |-                 # mandatory (ADE)
      What this plugin provides.
  my-plugin-decl:
    plugin:
      providers: [verb:myprobe]     # "<class>:<word>" — class ∈ kind|verb|deploy|step|builder|command|build
      source: builtin               # OR github.com/org/repo/candy/<name>  (out-of-tree)
  myprobe-check:                     # ADE: ≥1 deterministic check (its OWN acceptance test)
    check: the myprobe verb dispatches and passes
    plugin: myprobe
    plugin_input: { marker: hello }
    context: [runtime]
```

A candy with no `plugin:` block is an ordinary candy; one WITH it is a plugin. Full candy authoring surface
applies (`/charly-image:layer`), including the mandatory `version:`/`description:`/`plan:`+`check:` (ADE).

## One Provider, transport-invisible

Every reserved word — every kind, verb, deploy-target, step, builder, command, build — is served by ONE `Provider`
(`charly/provider.go`): `Reserved() string`, `Class() ProviderClass`, `Invoke(ctx, *Operation) (*Result,
error)`. A Provider is IN-PROCESS (a builtin, registered from `init()`) or OUT-OF-PROCESS (an external,
served over go-plugin gRPC). The registry (`providerRegistry`, `provider_registry.go`), the call sites, and
the bijection gate treat both identically — **the transport is invisible above the registry**. A
`check: { plugin: <word>, plugin_input: {…} }` step dispatches through `runPluginVerb` →
`providerRegistry.ResolveVerb(word)` → `Invoke`, whether the provider is compiled in or out-of-process.

**The `build` class (BUILD-ENGINE DISPATCH).** `ClassBuild` serves `build:box` + `build:generate`
(candy/plugin-build, COMPILED-IN): `charly box build` / `charly box generate` route through it instead of
calling `NewGenerator` inline. The plugin's Invoke (op `sdk.OpBuild`) is a thin dispatch/echo — it forwards
the host-constructed `spec.BuildRequest` (op.Params, verbatim) to `Executor.HostBuild(kind, …)` over the F10
reverse channel and ECHOES the `spec.BuildReply`; the host-builder (registered on `hostBuilders`) runs the
heavy engine HOST-SIDE in-process (`runBoxBuild` / `runBoxGenerate`). build:box → HostBuild("image"),
build:generate → HostBuild("containerfiles") — the host-builder KINDS are class-generic action nouns, never
the provider WORDS (the F11 uniform-API gate `TestNoSinglePluginAPISurface` forbids a provider word on that
surface). The engine (Generator / OCITarget / runtime Candy graph) STAYS core, UNCHANGED — only the wire
envelope crosses; the group/substrate/candy echo pattern applied to build. See `/charly-build:build` +
`/charly-build:generate`.

**In-proc reverse channel (compiled-in placement of HostBuild / the reverse channel).** A COMPILED-IN plugin
has no go-plugin broker, so it cannot dial the gRPC reverse channel an out-of-process plugin uses.
`inprocExecutorClient` (`charly/plugin_inproc_reverse.go`) implements `pb.ExecutorServiceClient` by delegating
DIRECTLY to a host-side `executorReverseServer` (no socket); `sdk.NewInProcExecutor` + `sdk.ContextWithExecutor`
thread it onto the Invoke context, and `sdk.ExecutorForInvoke(ctx, brokerID)` (ctx-first, broker-fallback) is
the ONE accessor a plugin's Invoke calls — so the plugin's reverse-channel code is byte-identical compiled-in
vs out-of-process (placement-invisible). It deliberately does NOT reuse `executorInvoker` (which stays
grpcProvider-ONLY — that interface is the discriminator routing external verbs to `ExternalPluginStep`, and a
compiled-in provider must not collide with it); the in-proc reverse channel is threaded by the build dispatch
inline. This is the general foundation the "every builtin routes through the reverse channel" direction needs;
its first consumer is the `build` class.

## Placement: builtin OR external, in-proc OR out-of-process — at deploy AND build time

Placement is a free, per-plugin choice, invisible above the registry: a provider runs EITHER compiled into
`charly` (a builtin, in-process) OR dynamically loaded from an out-of-tree candy (an external, out-of-process
over go-plugin gRPC), and the SAME provider works in either placement with ZERO authoring change. The strategic
direction is that every internal/builtin provider migrates external over time — so author every plugin
placement-agnostic from day one, and design it to work either way.

**Every class is placement-free** — kind, verb, deploy-target, step, builder, AND command are ALL
external-capable. An external (out-of-tree) COMMAND plugin contributes a `charly <word>` CLI subcommand
dispatched OUT-OF-PROCESS: the declared word is prescanned into the Kong grammar before parse, and the provider
is LAZY-connected on the first actual `charly <word>` invocation, which forwards the pass-through args via
`Invoke(OpRun)`. `builtinCommandBase.Invoke` returning "in-process only" is the BUILTIN command path ALONE (a
builtin command contributes via its static `KongCommand()` + Go `Run` handler and never serves itself
out-of-process) — NOT a class-level limit. Each class's leg differs by lifecycle phase: verb/deploy/step/
builder ride build (`OpEmit`/`OpResolve`) and/or deploy (`OpExecute`); command rides CLI invocation (`OpRun`);
a **kind** rides CONFIG LOAD (`OpLoad`) — its serving plugin is recognized + connected at config-PARSE by the
F4 prescan (`registerDeclaredKind` + `connectDeclaredKindPlugins`, re-entrancy-guarded), so a `kind: <word>`
entity whose plugin is NOT compiled in decodes via `runPluginKind` during load. Reference (out-of-process-only):
`candy/plugin-example-kind`; loader mechanism: `/charly-internals:go` (`plugin_prescan.go`).

**A plugin DECLARES its lifecycle PHASE (F9).** Beyond its class, a capability declares a `Phase` (the
`sdk.Phase*` set: `bootstrap → schema → load → build → runtime`, default `runtime`) via
`ProvidedCapability.Phase` over Describe — the ordered point at which the kernel loads/invokes it. The
**`bootstrap`** phase runs BEFORE config validation/migration: the kernel invokes a bootstrap plugin's
`OpBootstrap` on the RAW config bytes (`runBootstrapPhase`, in `LoadUnified` before the schema gate), applying
any transformed bytes it returns — so early-running capabilities (migrate, egress) can themselves be plugins.
Bootstrap plugins are **compiled-in only** (no validated config exists yet to discover an out-of-process
source). Reference: `candy/plugin-example-bootstrap` (a no-op returning the bytes unchanged). M15 (migrate) /
M16 (egress) move those in-core capabilities onto this phase machinery.

**A kind decode is FLAT or STRUCTURAL (F5).** A FLAT kind (the default) lands its `OpLoad` body OPAQUELY in
`uf.PluginKinds[disc][name]` (F4). A STRUCTURAL kind sets `ProvidedCapability.Structural = true` (the proto
`structural` field) in its Describe — its `OpLoad` returns a `spec.Deploy` (BundleNode) MEMBER TREE the host
folds into `uf.Bundle`, the SAME map the in-proc pod/candy decoders populate, so the entity participates in
deploy/check exactly like a builtin (the folded member goes through the SAME `validateDeploy`). This is the
channel that externalizes the structural kind decoders — ALL of them are now DONE: **`group` (C2-group,
candy/plugin-group)**, **the 5 deploy-substrate kinds pod/vm/k8s/local/android (C2-substrate,
candy/plugin-substrate — one provider serving all 5)**, and **the LAST one, the `candy` box⊻layer factory
(C2-candy, candy/plugin-candy-kind)** — all COMPILED-IN. The substrate consumer added the TEMPLATE-map fold
arm: a substrate node in standalone-TEMPLATE shape (a bare `vm:`/`pod:` — no from:/image:, no members) folds
into the typed map `uf.Pod`/`uf.VM`/`uf.K8s`/`uf.Local`/`uf.Android`, alongside the deploy-shape fold into
`uf.Bundle`; candy folds into `uf.Box` (image) / `uf.Candy` (layer). So EVERY authoring kind is plugin-served:
the `#Node` disjunction has ZERO built-in arms (`#Node: {...}` — a structural gate only) and `spec.KindWords`
is EMPTY. (candy's bootstrap-critical box⊻layer routing — candyIsImage + buildCandy — STAYS core: the
discovered-candy pre-check calls it directly, and the COMPILED-IN candy plugin registers at init before any
load, so there is no bootstrap cycle. candy is `Structural:false` — it nests no deploy members — and routes
to the host's foldCandyKind by an explicit disc branch.)

**AUTHORED-member INPUT-threading (the enabler that makes group/substrate externalization real).** A
structural kind's whole POINT is preserving the node's AUTHORED resource-member children (peers, nested
pod-in-pod, cross-member `${HOST:…}` checks) — but they CANNOT ride `op.Params`: that JSON is unified against
the plugin's CLOSED `#<Kind>Input` def, which the member subtree would violate. So the HOST pre-decodes the
authored member children via the SAME core `buildBundleNode` recursion the builtin path uses
(`buildResourceMemberChildren` — ONE member-decode source of truth, R3) and threads the decoded subtree to
`OpLoad` via `op.Env` (`spec.StructuralKindLoadEnv{Members}`). The plugin decodes only its kind-specific scalar
body from `op.Params` and ATTACHES the host-threaded members to its `spec.Deploy` reply — Members for a
targetless kind (group), Children for a workload — so the reconstructed `uf.Bundle` entry is BYTE-EQUIVALENT to
the FORMER builtin `group`'s in-proc decode — the invariant C2-group's `check-group` bed + the
`TestExternalStructKind_StructuralDecode` byte-equivalence test both prove (`${HOST:…}` refs survive as
literals, resolved later by tree position). A
FLAT kind carrying member children is a HARD error (never a silent drop). The parser admits sub-entity children
under a recognized external STRUCTURAL kind (`externalKindMayNestMembers`), core non-resource kinds stay guarded.
Reference (out-of-process-only): `candy/plugin-example-structkind` (decodes deploy-config scalars from
`op.Params`, attaches host-threaded members); the host fold is `runPluginKind` (`/charly-internals:go`); the
byte-equivalence witness is `TestExternalStructKind_StructuralDecode` + the `check-structkind` runtime bed.

**Rich-value variant (C2-substrate + C2-candy — the HOST-pre-decode+ECHO case).** The `op.Params`-decode above
works for a kind whose value is SCALAR-simple (group's `#GroupInput`). The 5 substrate kinds
(pod/vm/k8s/local/android) AND the `candy` box⊻layer factory have a RICH, core-referencing value
(`#Vm`/`#Deploy`/`#LibvirtDomain`/`#Candy`/`#Box`/… with host-canonicalized shorthand like `tunnel:`/`port:`)
that a plugin CANNOT re-decode soundly from `op.Params` nor validate with a self-contained schema. So
candy/plugin-substrate AND candy/plugin-candy-kind use the `spec.StructuralKindLoadEnv.Standalone` channel: the
HOST pre-decodes the WHOLE CANONICAL node via the core loader (`buildBundleNode` deploy / `decodeNodeValue`
template for substrate; `candyIsImage` + `buildCandy` for candy — the bootstrap-critical routing that STAYS
core), validates its value host-side against the KEPT `#<Kind>Value` / `#CandyValue` def
(`validateKindValueCUE`), and threads the canonical result via `op.Env`; the plugin is a PURE ECHO
(`InputDef:""`, no `validateAuthoredPluginInput`), and the host folds the echo into `uf.Bundle` (deploy) / the
typed template map `uf.Pod`/`uf.VM`/… (template) / `uf.Box` (candy-image) / `uf.Candy` (candy-layer).
Byte-equivalence over ALL shapes: `TestSubstrateKind_BothShapesByteEquivalent` +
`TestCandyKind_BothShapesByteEquivalent` (against the direct core decode) + box validate across all repos (candy
is THE core entity) + the `check-substrate` runtime bed. References: `candy/plugin-substrate`,
`candy/plugin-candy-kind` (distinct from `candy/plugin-candy`, the `command:candy` CLI plugin).

**A kind may serve a DEEP `OpValidate` check (F7/C8).** Beyond the static CUE input-def gate the host always
runs (`validateAuthoredPluginInput` — unifies the body against the served `#<Kind>Input`), a kind that sets
`ProvidedCapability.Validates = true` (the proto `validates` field) ALSO serves `OpValidate`: at load, the host
dispatches `Invoke(OpValidate)` with the body, and the plugin returns `spec.Diagnostics` (`{Items: [{Severity,
Message, Path}]}`) — any error-severity item FAILS the load with the messages. Use it for checks CUE cannot
express (cross-field invariants, semantic rules). Reference: `candy/plugin-example-kind` (rejects the sentinel
`marker: INVALID`); dispatch is `runPluginKind` (`/charly-internals:go`).
See "Authoring an external COMMAND plugin" below.

- **The perf invariant that makes placement free.** A builtin dispatches through its typed in-proc fast path
  (`CheckVerbProvider.RunVerb` / `KindProvider.DecodeNode` / `DeployTargetProvider.ResolveTarget` /
  `StepProvider.Emit*`) and NEVER marshals the Op into the serializable `Invoke`
  envelope; the JSON envelope (`marshalJSON`) is paid ONLY out-of-process. Choosing builtin therefore costs no
  envelope tax — placement is a free build/deploy decision, not a performance trade-off. Locked by
  `TestPerfGate_BuiltinVerbsSkipEnvelope` + `BenchmarkVerbTypedDispatchFork` (0-alloc) vs
  `BenchmarkVerbEnvelopeMarshal` (`provider_bench_test.go`).
- **Plugin↔plugin + host-build (F10).** A plugin running WITH a reverse channel (deploy/step/check/build —
  any Invoke the host stands a broker up for) can call BACK to the host to invoke ANOTHER plugin or request a
  host-side build, via the `sdk.Executor`: `InvokeProvider(class, word, op, params, env)` — the host resolves
  the peer in the registry and Invokes it on the caller's behalf (threading the SAME venue executor into an
  out-of-process target over a nested broker — the host is the dispatch broker, since it owns the registry);
  and `HostBuild(kind, spec)` — the host runs the registered host-builder for `kind` (the build ENGINE stays in
  core). This is the shared-capability seam: a SHARED plugin (egress, k8s-gen, arbiter) is "a plugin others
  invoke", never "kept in core". Reference: `candy/plugin-example-dispatch`; mechanism:
  `/charly-internals:install-plan` (`plugin_dispatch_reverse.go`).
- **Deploy time.** An external deploy-target provider runs its full Add/Test/Update/Del lifecycle over the
  host-served executor reverse channel — the plugin applies the deployment's ops on the real venue it cannot
  hold across the process boundary (`OpExecute`), and the host records the returned teardown ops to the ledger.
  A bed/deploy that uses an external deploy SUBSTRATE word is recognized at config-PARSE time (before the
  provider connects) and routed host-side by the shared check classifier. **A substrate may ALSO bring its OWN
  host-side venue LIFECYCLE + PRERESOLVE (F6):** a `class:deploy` capability declaring `Lifecycle=true` gets a
  wire-backed `substrateLifecycle` registered at plugin-load — the host calls its `OpPrepareVenue`/`OpStart`/
  `OpStop`/`OpStatus`/`OpRebuild`/… (host→plugin on `Provider.Invoke`), and `OpPrepareVenue` returns a
  `spec.VenueDescriptor` the host re-materializes into a real executor (the live executor never crosses the
  wire). One declaring `Preresolve=true` gets a wire-backed `deployPreresolver` (`OpPreresolve` → the opaque
  `DeployVenue.Substrate` payload), generalizing the in-core k8s/android preresolvers. Reference
  (out-of-process-only): `candy/plugin-example-lifecycle`; mechanism: `/charly-internals:install-plan`
  (`substrate_lifecycle_grpc.go`). This is the channel M4 reuses to externalize the pod/vm lifecycles. An external **`run:` plugin verb /
  step** composed INSIDE a deploy (a `local:`/`vm:` target, where the install runs ON the target, not baked
  into an image) likewise EXECUTES at deploy: it lowers to an `ExternalPluginStep` IR node which the external
  `local:`/`vm:` deploy walk reaches as a host-engine step over `RunHostStep`, where `executeExternalPluginStep`
  `Invoke(OpExecute)`s WITH the live `DeployExecutor` on the SAME reverse channel, so the plugin runs
  its deploy-context effect on the target and RETURNS its teardown `ReverseOp`s, which the host records to
  the ledger and replays at `charly bundle del` (record-and-replay, the SAME `spec.DeployReply` wire as the
  deploy target — R3). Only an EXTERNAL provider is routed there (the `executorInvoker` discriminator,
  satisfied SOLELY by the out-of-process `grpcProvider`); a builtin `ProvisionActor` verb keeps its in-proc
  shell path. So the verb/step class is external-capable at BOTH build (`OpEmit`, next bullet) AND deploy
  (`OpExecute`), placement-agnostic. Detail → `/charly-internals:install-plan` (the `externalDeployTarget`
  lifecycle + the `ExternalPluginStep` IR kind + the `OpExecute` reverse channel).
- **Build time.** `charly box build` / `charly box generate` connect the project's external plugin candies during
  image generation, so a plugin EXECUTES at build to emit its Containerfile contribution, placement-agnostically
  (a builtin in-proc, an external over gRPC) — and BOTH the verb/step leg AND the builder leg ride the SAME
  connect seam, class-agnostically:
  - a `run:` plugin **verb / step** returns a Containerfile fragment via `OpEmit` → `spec.EmitReply.Fragment`,
    spliced verbatim into the Containerfile (egress-validated).
  - a **builder** (`ClassBuilder`) returns a multi-stage build via `Invoke(OpResolve)` → `spec.BuilderResolveReply`:
    its `Stage` (a `FROM <ref> AS <name>` block) is spliced PRE-main-FROM, its `CopyArtifacts`+`CopyBinary`
    (`COPY --from=<stage> …`) POST-main-FROM, and an INLINE builder's `InlineFragment` in-candy. This serves BOTH
    the four DETECTION-builders (pixi/npm/aur/cargo — selected by a candy's detect files, rendered via the shared
    `charly/plugin/kit.BuilderResolve`, C10) AND an out-of-tree builder a candy selects with `external_builder: <word>`.
    This is the build-time BUILDER leg — the multi-stage counterpart of the verb/step OpEmit leg, so `builder` is an
    external-capable class at build too (alongside verb/kind/deploy/step). The `command` class has no build-time
    leg — a command dispatches at CLI invocation, not at build — and is external-capable THERE via `Invoke(OpRun)`
    (the Placement paragraph above), so EVERY class (kind/verb/deploy/step/builder/command) is external-capable.
  This is operator-authorized build-time execution of host-built plugin code: a project's composed external
  plugins run as host code during its image builds. Detail → `/charly-build:generate` + `/charly-internals:generate-source`.

## The per-plugin CUE schema — the single source, two consumers

**Every plugin ships its OWN `.cue` schema, and it is the SINGLE SOURCE for that plugin's params.** It is
SELF-CONTAINED (package-less, references no base def) and used two ways — the SAME contract core `spec` uses:

1. **DEV-TIME → Go params.** `cue exp gengotypes` (driven by `task cue:gen`, which wraps the schema with
   `package params` + `@go(params)`) emits the plugin's `params/cue_types_gen.go`. The provider decodes
   `plugin_input` into that TYPED struct — never a hand-parsed `map[string]any`, never a hand-written struct.
2. **RUNTIME → schema-over-RPC.** The plugin SERVES its `.cue` source over the Provider **`Describe`**
   channel (the proto `Capabilities.schema_cue` field + structured `ProvidedCapability{class,word,input_def}`).
   The host splices it onto charly's base schema (`base ++ plugin`, via `internal/schemaconcat` — the SAME
   concat contract as the runtime `sharedCueSchema`, R3) and validates every authored `plugin_input` against
   the plugin's def (e.g. `#MyprobeInput`). The host **never reads a candy's `schema/` dir from disk** — the
   schema travels WITH the plugin.

**A `class:step` plugin ALSO declares its install-step contract over Describe (F3).** A step plugin (a
PLUGIN-contributed install-step KIND, distinct from a `class:verb` step which rides the fixed
`ExternalPlugin` kind) sets `ProvidedCapability.StepContract{Scope,Venue,Gate,Emits}` (the proto
`step_contract` field; `sdk.ProvidedCapability.StepContract`) — the host carries that DECLARED contract so
a `run: plugin: <word>` lowers to an `externalStep` (kind `external:<word>`, opaque Payload) the OPEN
DEFAULT ARM dispatches via `OpExecute`, with NO compiled-in case. Reverse is NOT declared (an external
step's teardown ops are recorded dynamically from its `OpExecute` reply). **BUILD leg (F-STEP-EMIT):**
`StepContract.Emits=true` declares the step ALSO produces a build-context Containerfile FRAGMENT — served by
`Invoke(OpEmit)` → `spec.EmitReply.Fragment`. Composed into a POD overlay (add_candy), the pod-overlay
`OCITarget` open external-step arm Invokes that OpEmit and splices the fragment (`Emits=false` → a
deploy-only step, skipped on the image build, like apk); a HOST-COUPLED step's OpEmit calls back
`HostBuild("step-emit", …)` for a host-engine-rendered fragment. A step plugin serving OpEmit is a PURE
step (self-contained fragment); the reference `candy/plugin-example-stepkind` serves BOTH legs (OpExecute at
deploy, OpEmit at build). A `class:step` plugin may ALSO serve ONLY the build-emit leg: the compiled-in
`candy/plugin-installstep` serves `OpEmit` for the compiler-emitted builtin InstallStep kinds, fed the
compiler-produced step VIEW as payload — those kinds keep their typed IR + `kit.WalkPlans` deploy leg
(so the plugin needs no `OpExecute`); the host routes them by `pluginEmitStepWords`, not the
`external:<word>` arm. Two sub-categories: the PURE kinds
(file/shell-hook/shell-snippet/service-packaged/service-custom/repo-change/apk-install, C1.1; + the
no-op-emit reboot, C1.6 — `apk-install`/`reboot` declare `Emits=false` and are skipped at build) format
their fragment directly from the view; the HOST-COUPLED `system-packages` (C1.2) + `builder` (C1.3) +
`local-pkg-install` (C1.4) + `op` (C1.5) kinds instead call back `HostBuild("step-emit", …)` (echoing the returned
`EmitReply`) because their render needs the host build engine (`system-packages`: DistroDef format templates;
`builder`: the multi-stage `buildStageContext` + `RenderTemplate` engine; `local-pkg-install`:
`renderLocalPkgImageInstall` — the host localpkg build + staging; `op`: the RICHEST — `Generator.emitTasks`, the
full per-verb render pipeline with COPY staging + op coalescing). Authoring + IR mechanism: `/charly-internals:install-plan` (the
`externalStep` row + the build-emit externalization note); reference: `candy/plugin-example-stepkind`,
`candy/plugin-installstep`.

**Zero builtin/external distinction in schema handling.** Both arrive at the host as a `PluginUnit`
(`Providers` + `Schema`) from `PluginTransport.Connect` — `InProcTransport` for a builtin, `LocalTransport`
(go-plugin exec) for an external. The host's load/gate/validate code NEVER branches on which kind it is. The
only difference is WHERE the plugin runs (compiled into charly vs a separate process), and therefore WHEN its
providers register (a builtin at `init()`, an external at deploy/check load) — a load-TIMING property, never a
schema-handling one.

### The load gate + the validator (one each, shared)

- `registerPluginUnitSchema(name, schema)` is THE load gate (`plugin_loader.go`), byte-identical for builtin
  and external: it rejects an **empty** schema, a schema that will not **splice** onto the base, and a declared
  `input_def` the schema does not define — all LOUD failures at load. Builtins are gated at process start
  (`loadBuiltinPluginUnits`, a `sync.Once` pass over every registered unit); externals at connect
  (`loadPluginUnit` → build on host → `LocalTransport.Connect` → gate → register).
- `validateAuthoredPluginInput(class, word, json)` is THE validator: it looks the def up in the process-wide
  `pluginSchemas` set (filled by the gate) and unifies the authored input against it. Wired into
  `runPluginVerb` before dispatch — a missing/empty/typo'd field is a hard `TestFail`, not a silent surprise.

## The retired in-charly-module builtin path

There is NO LONGER an "in-charly-module builtin" path — a Provider whose Go lived in
`charly/plugin/builtins/<name>/` and registered from `package main`'s `init()` via
`RegisterBuiltinPluginUnit`. It was retired as each builtin relocated into a candy: the
`charly/plugin/builtins/` subtree is GONE, and the last unit, `examplerunverb`, is now the compiled-in
kit candy `candy/plugin-examplerunverb/` (guarded by `charly/plugin_examplerunverb_relocated_test.go`).
The `source: builtin` candy-linkage form is likewise gone (exampleprobe is a real candy module).

Every builtin today is ONE of the two CANDY forms below — a candy COMPILED IN via `compiled_plugins:`
("Authoring a COMPILED-IN plugin candy") or a HOST-COUPLED check-verb KIT candy ("Authoring a
HOST-COUPLED check-verb candy"). Author new builtins as one of those; there is no `charly/plugin/builtins/`
to mirror.

## Authoring an EXTERNAL plugin (out-of-tree git repo)

The candy IS its own Go module (`go.mod` + `replace …/charly => …` while in-repo). Mirror
`candy/plugin-example-external/`:

- `schema/<name>.cue` — the self-contained def (same shape as a builtin's).
- `params/cue_types_gen.go` — generated the same way (the gen loop also covers the in-repo example).
- `main.go` — `func main() { sdk.Serve(&provider{}, &meta{}) }`; the provider decodes `plugin_input` into the
  generated `params.<Word>Input`; `meta.Describe` returns `sdk.BuildCapabilities(calver, []sdk.ProvidedCapability{…},
  schemaFS, "schema")` (it `//go:embed`s `schema/*.cue`). `BuildCapabilities` concatenates + compiles the
  schema STANDALONE (failing loudly before serving) and ships the source in `schema_cue`.
- The candy's `plugin.source` is the `github.com/org/repo/candy/<name>` ref. charly's loader fetches the repo
  (the same `@github` resolver candies use), `go build`s the provider binary ON THE HOST, and connects
  out-of-process via `LocalTransport`. The host build runs with `GOWORK=off` so a repo-root `go.work` cannot
  reject a non-member candy dir — the out-of-process build is always standalone in the candy's own module.

## Authoring a COMPILED-IN plugin candy (the candy compiled INTO charly)

The SAME out-of-tree candy can be COMPILED INTO charly — the in-proc placement of a candy, selected
per-charly-build by `charly.yml` `compiled_plugins:`. This ships a plugin candy INSIDE the binary
WITHOUT its Go living in charly's module (it rides `go.work`). `candy/plugin-example-external/` is the
reference: it is BOTH the out-of-process example above AND the compiled-in example — one provider, two
placements, ZERO authoring change.

- The provider lives in the candy's IMPORTABLE root package (`NewProvider() pb.ProviderServer` +
  `NewMeta() pb.PluginMetaServer` + `//go:embed schema/*.cue`), NOT `package main`. `main.go` moves to
  `cmd/serve/` as a 3-line `sdk.Serve(<pkg>.NewProvider(), <pkg>.NewMeta())` shim (the out-of-process
  entrypoint, host-built only when the candy is NOT compiled in).
- List the candy in `compiled_plugins:` (the embedded `charly/charly.yml` for the default binary; a
  consumer's own `charly.yml` for a custom footprint — "which plugins are in the binary" is a normal
  candy-inclusion choice).
- `pluginsgen` (`charly/internal/pluginsgen`, run by `task build:charly` before `go build`, `GOWORK=off`,
  stdlib+yaml only) reads `compiled_plugins:` and emits `charly/plugins_generated.go` (one
  `registerCompiledPlugin(<pkg>.NewProvider(), <pkg>.NewMeta())` per candy) + the repo-root `go.work` (a
  `use ./candy/<name>` per candy, so `go build ./charly` resolves the candy imports). Both are COMMITTED
  + reproducibility-gated (`TestPluginsGenReproducible`).
- `registerCompiledPlugin` drives `InProcServedTransport`: it calls the candy's `Describe` IN-PROCESS, runs
  the SAME `buildUnit` capability-lift + schema gate an external goes through (so the compiled-in schema
  enters the SAME `loadBuiltinPluginUnits` gate), and registers each capability wrapped in an
  `inprocProvider` (origin `"builtin"`) — the in-proc twin of `grpcProvider`. Dispatch is registry-routed,
  transport-invisible.
- COEXIST: a candy compiled in (origin `"builtin"`) is SKIPPED by `loadProjectPlugins` (the out-of-process
  host build is redundant); a candy NOT in `compiled_plugins:` still host-builds + connects out-of-process
  when a plan references its word. Placement is a per-charly-build choice, invisible above the registry.
- PERF: a compiled-in pb CANDY dispatches through the pb `Invoke` envelope IN-PROCESS (no socket) via
  `inprocProvider`, whereas a HOST-COUPLED KIT candy (next section) uses its typed fast path
  (`RunVerb`/`DecodeNode`, no envelope). The pb-candy path pays the JSON envelope but not the gRPC transport.

## Authoring a HOST-COUPLED check-verb candy (the kit — dual-placement via the reverse channel)

A check verb whose logic needs the LIVE check engine — exec-in-container, host-vantage HTTP, host TCP
dial (`file`/`http`/`port`/`command`/`service`/…) — implements **`charly/plugin/kit`**, the importable
contract for the check engine. It runs in EITHER placement, invisibly above the registry: COMPILED-IN
(charly passes the live `*Runner` as the `kit.CheckContext`) OR OUT-OF-PROCESS (the CheckContext legs are
served back over the host's reverse channel — ExecutorService for `cc.Exec()` + CheckContextService for
`cc.HTTPDo`/`cc.AddBackground`, F2 — while the scalar legs `Mode`/`Box`/`Instance`/`Distros`/`DialTimeout`
ride the env_json snapshot). `candy/plugin-port` + `candy/plugin-http` are the reference (both served
OUT-OF-PROCESS in the default build); the remaining kit candies are compiled-in by default until M1 adds
their `cmd/serve` shim. Shape:

- The candy's importable root package implements `kit.CheckVerbProvider` (`Reserved()` + `RunVerb(ctx,
  cc kit.CheckContext, op *spec.Op) kit.Result`) — the verb's logic (formerly the `r.runX` *Runner
  method) lives HERE, reaching the deployment through `cc.Exec().RunCapture` / `cc.Mode()` /
  `cc.DialTimeout()` / `cc.HTTPDo(...)` / `cc.Distros()`. It exports `NewCheckVerb() kit.CheckVerbProvider`
  + the raw schema `embed.FS` (`SchemaFS` + `SchemaDir`) + `InputDefs`.
- COMPILED-IN: charly's `registerCompiledCheckVerb` (generated into `plugins_generated.go` by pluginsgen,
  which detects the kit shape by the exported `NewCheckVerb`) wraps it in a `kitVerbAdapter` (a package-main
  `CheckVerbProvider` that passes the live `*Runner` as a `kit.CheckContext` via `runnerCheckContext` and
  converts `kit.Result`→`CheckResult`), concatenates the candy's schema (the candy can't import
  `internal/schemaconcat`), and registers through the SAME `RegisterBuiltinPluginUnit` gate (origin
  `"builtin"`). Dispatch is the SAME `runOne`→`CheckVerbProvider.RunVerb` path a compiled-in candy verb
  uses — full typed fast path, the real `*Runner`, no envelope.
- OUT-OF-PROCESS: a `cmd/serve/main.go` shim calls `sdk.ServeCheckVerb(pkg.NewCheckVerb(), calver,
  pkg.SchemaFS, pkg.SchemaDir, pkg.InputDefs)`, which wraps the kit verb in a pb.ProviderServer whose Invoke
  reconstructs a `sdkCheckContext` from the InvokeRequest broker (ExecutorService + CheckContextService) +
  the env_json snapshot, then runs `RunVerb`. The host go-builds `./cmd/serve` + connects via
  `LocalTransport` when the candy is NOT in `compiled_plugins`; `invokeVerbProvider` (provider_checkenv.go)
  serves BOTH reverse services on one broker id. The verdict round-trips as the same `{status,message}`
  every out-of-process verb returns.
- `kit` imports only the stdlib + `charly/spec`; the candy imports `kit` + `sdk` + `spec` + its `params`.

A kit candy keeps the verb's logic (RunVerb on `kit.CheckContext`) OUTSIDE charly's module while preserving
the typed fast path — runnable in-proc (compiled-in, the real `*Runner`, no envelope) OR out-of-process (the
reverse channel) with ZERO authoring change.

The SDK (`charly/plugin/sdk`) is the primary charly package an external module imports — `Serve`,
`ServeCheckVerb` (the kit-verb out-of-process serve entry), `Handshake`, `BuildCapabilities`,
`ProvidedCapability`, `Conn`, plus the shared out-of-process check-verb helpers `ResultJSON`
(the `{status,message}` reply) / `CheckRequiredModifiers` (the required-modifier check) + the
`*Executor` venue methods `VenueCapture`/`VenueHasTool`/`VenueRunSilent`. An external module ALSO
imports the pure-helper package `charly/plugin/kit` directly (stdlib + `charly/spec` only —
`ShellQuote`, `TrimPreview`, `MethodSpec`, `WalkPlans`, …; the SDK imports it too). `schemaconcat`
stays `internal/` (the SDK, under `charly/`, imports it; the external module reaches it only
transitively through the SDK).

## Authoring an external COMMAND plugin (a `charly <word>` subcommand)

A `command:<word>` provider is an external plugin (authored exactly like the verb-class one above — its own Go
module, self-contained `schema/<name>.cue`, generated `params/`, `sdk.Serve` + `BuildCapabilities`) that
contributes a TOP-LEVEL `charly <word>` CLI subcommand. Mirror `candy/plugin-example-command/`:

- `plugin.providers: [command:<word>]` + `source: github.com/org/repo/candy/<name>` in the candy's `plugin:`
  block; `Describe` returns the capability with `Class: "command", Word: "<word>"`.
- `Invoke` handles `OpRun` (the command-run selector): the host forwards the user's pass-through CLI tokens
  from `charly <word> <args…>` as `op.Params = {"args": [...]}` marshalled DIRECTLY — NOT wrapped in the
  `plugin_input` envelope a verb CHECK step uses. The provider decodes that into its generated typed params
  struct (e.g. `params.<Word>Input` with an `Args []string` field) and does its effect.

The discovery → grammar → dispatch flow (host side, owned by `charly/plugin_command_prescan.go` +
`provider_command_external.go`): when the candy is discovered in the project, a byte-gated prescan
(`prescanProjectCommandWords`, run in `main` BEFORE `kong.Parse`) registers the declared word so `charly <word>`
PARSES; `collectExternalCommandPlugins` builds a Kong grammar holder for it with the provider UNconnected. The
host build + gRPC connect is LAZY — paid ONLY when the user actually runs the command: `dispatchExternalCommand`
calls `connectCommandPlugin` (scoped to the one word) then `Invoke(OpRun, {"args":[…]})`. So every `charly`
invocation that is NOT `charly <word>` is byte-for-byte unaffected. (A builtin command, by contrast, contributes
via its compiled-in `CommandProvider.KongCommand()` + Go `Run` handler — `provider_command.go`.)

**A command candy can ALSO be COMPILED IN (F8) — placement-invisible like every other class.** List its candy
in `compiled_plugins:` and it registers in-proc (an `inprocProvider`, Class command); the host builds the SAME
dynamic Kong grammar (`externalCommandHolder`, pass-through `Args`) and `dispatchCommand` routes it IN-PROC via
`Invoke(OpRun)` (`dispatchInProcCommand`) instead of `syscall.Exec` — the candy's `Invoke(OpRun)` handler runs in
charly's own process (native stdio/TTY). So author a command candy DUAL-PLACEMENT: an importable provider
package (`NewProvider`/`NewMeta`, `Invoke(OpRun)` runs the effect, `Describe` advertises `command:<word>`) + a
`cmd/serve` `sdk.Main(..., CliMain)` shim for the out-of-process path, both calling ONE shared effect (mirror
`candy/plugin-example-command`). This is the command half of compile-in-for-all-six-classes; the M-series moves
the dedicated builtin commands into candies on this surface.

## Why self-contained schemas

A plugin's `#<Word>Input` references NO base def, so it compiles STANDALONE — the exact property
`cue exp gengotypes` needs to generate Go params, AND the property that lets the SDK compile it serve-side.
The host's `base ++ plugin` splice therefore exists to detect a def-name **collision** with the base, not to
resolve base references. (`TestExternalSchemaSelfContained` proves a base-referencing schema fails a standalone
compile.)

## Verification

- `go test ./...` — the registry/transport/schema seams (`TestPluginGRPCRoundTrip`,
  `TestExternalPluginEndToEnd` proves the schema travels over RPC, `TestPluginSchemaSpliceValidation`,
  `TestBuiltinPluginSchemasSplice` is the CI gate that every builtin schema splices).
- `task cue:gen` — regenerates spec + every plugin's params; reproducible (a second run is a no-op).
- `charly box validate` — the candy + `plugin:` block (`validatePluginCandy` checks each capability is
  well-formed and, for `source: builtin`, that the provider is actually compiled in).
- R10: a disposable bed composing a builtin AND an external plugin, driven to a fresh `charly update` — the
  builtin's baked check + the external's out-of-process check both pass.

## Cross-References

- `/charly-internals:go` — the provider registry + the reserved-word spine (verbs/kinds/deploy/steps/builders/commands).
- `/charly-image:layer` — the candy authoring surface the `plugin:` block extends.
- `/charly-check:check` — the `plugin:` check verb + ADE (a plugin's own acceptance plan).
- `/charly-build:validate` — `charly box validate` rules.
- `/charly-internals:install-plan` — the `externalDeployTarget` deploy lifecycle (`OpExecute` reverse channel, ledger record) + the `OpEmit` build-time fragment; the deploy wire types in `charly/spec/deploy_wire.go`.
- `/charly-build:generate` + `/charly-internals:generate-source` — the build-time plugin connect seam + the `emitTasks` placement-agnostic plugin-verb dispatch (`OpEmit` → fragment).

## When to Use This Skill

Invoke before authoring or editing any `plugin:` block, any `charly/plugin/**` code, the plugin SDK, a
compiled-in plugin candy (`compiled_plugins:`) or host-coupled kit candy, an external plugin module, or the
plugin schema/param gen pipeline.
