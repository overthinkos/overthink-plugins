# Skill Maintenance Guidelines

## Overview

Skills are living documents at `plugins/<plugin>/skills/<name>/SKILL.md`. They are the primary knowledge source for Claude Code — always invoked before codebase exploration. This skill covers when and how to update them.

## Skill Dispatcher — the sole copy lives in CLAUDE.md R0

The trigger → skill dispatcher is the table in CLAUDE.md "Skill Dispatcher"
(Part I, immediately after R0) — the SOLE copy, deliberately mirrored nowhere
(duplication drifts). When multiple triggers apply, load ALL matching skills
in ONE message (parallel `Skill` calls). Full index: `plugins/README.md`.

## When to Update Skills

| Trigger | Action |
|---------|--------|
| Deployment step fails or needs undocumented workaround | Update the relevant `/charly-core:*`, `/charly-build:*`, `/charly-eval:*`, `/charly-automation:*`, kind plugin (`/charly-image:*`, `/charly-vm:*`, `/charly-kubernetes:*`, `/charly-local:*`, `/charly-pod:*`), per-pod plugin (`/charly-jupyter:*`, `/charly-coder:*`, …), or split-foundation plugin (`/charly-distros:*`, `/charly-languages:*`, `/charly-infrastructure:*`, `/charly-tools:*`) |
| Verification check missing from image skill | Add to the image skill's Verification section |
| Skill's recommended defaults are wrong | Fix in the skill, not CLAUDE.md |
| New feature added to charly CLI | Update `/charly-core:<cmd>` or `/charly-build:<cmd>` skill + `/charly-internals:go` source map |
| New candy or box added | Create skill via `charly box new candy` scaffold or manual SKILL.md |
| Bug fix changes behavior | Document the fix in affected skills |
| Cross-skill behavior discovered | Update Cross-References in all affected skills |
| A live bed contradicts a skill's claim (Risk Driven Development found it stale) | Fix the stale skill in the SAME change — RDD keeps the living docs honest; for a high-risk claim the running system is ground truth, not the doc |
| Removed identifier still referenced in skill paragraph (R5 self-test failed) | Update / delete the paragraph in the SAME commit as the removal (R5) |

## When NOT to Update Skills

- **Ephemeral issues** — use conversation context or memory
- **User-specific config** — use Claude Code memory system
- **Bug fixes in charly code** — the fix is in git; document behavioral changes in skills only
- **Anything derivable from code** — skills document *usage*, not implementation details
- **Historical / version-history content** — dated change notes, "renamed from", "previously / formerly / was", completed cutovers, retired / relocated identifiers → `CHANGELOG.md` (repo root), NEVER a skill or CLAUDE.md. Skills describe current behavior in present tense only. When a cutover lands, append its narrative to `CHANGELOG.md` and state the new standing rule forward-looking in the skill, with no history.

## How to Update

1. Edit the skill file at `plugins/<plugin>/skills/<skill-name>/SKILL.md`
2. If the insight affects cross-skill behavior, update CLAUDE.md too
3. After any non-trivial deployment session, ask: "Did we learn anything that future sessions should know?"

## Skill File Structure

```markdown
---
name: <skill-name>
description: |
  One-sentence description of when to invoke this skill.
  For layers: "Use when working with <component>."
  For images: "MUST be invoked before building, deploying, or troubleshooting the <image> image."

## CLAUDE.md vs Skills

| Content type | Where it belongs |
|-------------|-----------------|
| Project philosophy, architecture, key rules | CLAUDE.md |
| Command usage, flags, examples | `/charly-core:<cmd>` or `/charly-build:<cmd>` skill |
| Layer properties, packages, ports | per-pod plugin (`/charly-jupyter:<name>`, `/charly-coder:<name>`, …) or split-foundation plugin (`/charly-distros:*`, `/charly-languages:*`, `/charly-infrastructure:*`, `/charly-tools:*`) for base layers |
| Image composition, deployment, verification | per-pod plugin or `/charly-distros:<name>` / `/charly-infrastructure:<name>` for base images |
| Skill disambiguation (which skill to use) | CLAUDE.md R0 "Skill Dispatcher" (the sole copy; never mirrored) |
| Detailed operational patterns | Relevant `/charly-core:*` / `/charly-build:*` / `/charly-eval:*` / `/charly-automation:*` / kind-plugin skill |
| Version history / past changes / renames / cutover narration | `CHANGELOG.md` (repo root) — never CLAUDE.md or a skill |
| Long-term thesis / vision / aspiration ("why & where it's going") | `VISION.md` (repo root) — never restating command usage, architecture, or history |

## Command skills vs topic skills

Most skills under `plugins/charly-core/skills/` and `plugins/charly-build/skills/`
map 1:1 to a top-level charly command (e.g. `/charly-build:build` ↔ `charly box build`,
`/charly-core:charly-status` ↔ `charly status`).
**Topic skills** are the exception: they don't correspond to a
top-level command but cover a cross-cutting concept surfaced by flags
or layer composition. Today's topic skills:

| Skill | Surfaced via | What it covers |
|---|---|---|
| `/charly-automation:enc` | `charly config --encrypt`, `charly config mount`, `charly config unmount`, `charly config passwd` | Encrypted-volume (gocryptfs) semantics, keyring resolution, `charly-enc-<image>-<volume>.scope` lifecycle |
| `/charly-automation:openclaw-deploy` | Composing `openclaw-*` layers | OpenClaw AI gateway deployment story |
| `/charly-automation:sidecar` | `charly config --sidecar tailscale` | Sidecar-container model, pod networking, env-var routing |

When adding a new command, always create a matching command skill. Consider a topic skill when a concept spans multiple commands or layers and the natural home isn't any single command's skill. Keep the frontmatter `description:` explicit about the topic nature (the blocking `Skill:` tool dispatcher matches on description keywords).

## Plugin Structure

Plugins are sorted into four use-case buckets. Directory names live at
`plugins/<name>/` (no `charly-` prefix); plugin.json `name:` fields keep the
`charly-` prefix; every skill is invoked as `/charly-<plugin>:<skill>`.

The authoritative per-plugin skill counts and purposes are the bucket tables
in `plugins/README.md` — point there, never copy them (counts drift).

## Agent & signpost conventions

### Agents (`plugins/<plugin>/agents/<name>.md`)

Sub-agents are markdown + YAML frontmatter (`name`, `description`, `tools`,
`model`, …), discovered from a plugin's `agents/` directory (currently only
`charly-internals/agents/`). **Plugin-loaded agents IGNORE the `hooks`,
`mcpServers`, and `permissionMode` frontmatter fields** — keep those out of
plugin agents (use `.claude/agents/` or `settings.json` if you genuinely
need them). The charly roster splits into **enforcers** (root-cause-analyzer,
layer-validator, testing-validator — gate claims) and **executors**
(eval-bed-runner, deploy-verifier — drive `charly eval` and return verbatim
proof). Full story: `/charly-internals:agents`. Dynamic workflows are NOT plugin
content — they live in the superproject's `.claude/workflows/*.js`.

### Per-directory CLAUDE.md signposts (hybrid)

The repo-root `CLAUDE.md` is the single canonical R0–R10 rule-set.
Per-directory `CLAUDE.md` files (`charly/`, `candy/`, `plugins/`, and each
`box/<distro>` submodule) are THIN signposts only: they name the skills to
load for that area and point back to root. They MUST NOT restate any rule —
duplication drifts (the hooks and an earlier layer-validator both drifted
exactly this way). Subagents and teammates load the full `CLAUDE.md`
hierarchy from their working directory, so a signpost reaches a worker scoped
to that subtree without bloating root.

## Two-Layer Sync Architecture

The project uses two complementary sync mechanisms with `.gitignore` as the
boundary:

| What | Synced by | Visibility |
|------|-----------|------------|
| Code, CLAUDE.md, skills, layers, images | Git | Public (committed) |
| `.claude/memory/` (auto-memory) | Syncthing | Private (gitignored) |
| `.claude/settings.local.json` (personal overrides) | Syncthing | Private (gitignored) |
| `.claude/settings.json` (project policy) | Git | Public (committed) |

Memory setup: `autoMemoryDirectory: ".claude/memory"` in
`.claude/settings.local.json`. Both `settings.local.json` and `memory/`
propagate via Syncthing so your working state follows you across machines
without polluting the public repo.

Rule of thumb: **if it's useful to every contributor, it lives in git**
(skills, CLAUDE.md, code). **If it's useful only to you, it lives in the
Syncthing-synced half** (memory, personal settings).

## Cross-References

- `/charly-internals:go` — Source code structure, adding new commands
- `/charly-internals:generate-source` — Understanding generated Containerfiles
- `/charly-internals:agents` — Sub-agents, dynamic workflows, agent teams; how they drive the `charly eval` beds; the hooks doctrine; the signpost convention
- `/charly-build:validate` — Validation rules
- All `/charly:*` skills — Individual command documentation

## When to Use This Skill

Invoke when updating documentation, creating new skills, auditing skill coverage, or deciding where new information belongs (CLAUDE.md vs skill vs memory).
