# Local Deploy — Applying Candies Directly to a Linux Filesystem

## Overview

`target: local` deployments apply a box or candy's install recipe directly to a Linux filesystem instead of baking it into a container image. The destination is named by the deployment's `host:` field (Ansible-style):

- `host: local` (literal) or absent → `ShellExecutor` (run on this machine).
- Anything else → `SSHExecutor` (ssh(1) reads `~/.ssh/config` + ssh-agent for keys, host-key checking, options).

The same `InstallPlan` IR that drives container deploys (via `PodDeployTarget`, incl. `add_candy:` overlay synthesis through `OCITarget`) is consumed by the external `deploy:local` plugin (`candy/plugin-deploy-local`), which `externalDeployTarget` hands the plan over the executor reverse channel; the plugin walks it via the shared out-of-process walk (`charly/plugin/kit.WalkPlans`), translating each IR step into shell commands, `podman run <builder>` invocations for compile-needing work, and systemd unit writes. The step kinds the plugin cannot render itself (`BuilderStep`, `LocalPkgInstallStep`, `SystemPackagesStep`, act-verb `OpStep`, `ExternalPluginStep`) are driven on the HOST via the `RunHostStep` reverse-channel RPC. (`charly box build` itself emits Containerfiles via the separate `writeCandySteps` → `emitTasks` generator, not the IR — see `/charly-internals:install-plan`.)

The deploy applies host packages + configs ONLY. Container images required for `charly check run` / `charly check live` are ensured by the check preflight (see `/charly-check:check` "Image preflight"), not by the deploy. Deploys (any target) emit zero image-pull / image-build steps — that's the CLAUDE.md "Deploy fetches NOTHING speculative" Key Rule, codified at the type level. Migration of legacy `image:` blocks: `charly migrate` (idempotent).

Use cases:
- Installing a focused tool set (ripgrep + uv + direnv) on your workstation without a container.
- Iterating on a candy locally, then baking it into a box.
- Pushing a profile to a remote machine over SSH (CI runner, lab box, bastion) without ad-hoc shell scripting.

## SSH config + agent are the configuration

charly contains **zero** custom SSH-key resolution. We do not read `~/.ssh/config`, we do not detect ssh-agent, we do not prompt for keys. `ssh(1)` does it all. Configure your destinations via `~/.ssh/config` `Host` stanzas, load keys into `ssh-agent`, and `charly` shells out to `ssh` with no `-i` / `-o StrictHostKeyChecking=` / `-o UserKnownHostsFile=` overrides.

For VM destinations, `charly vm create <name>` writes a managed Host stanza into `~/.config/charly/ssh_config` (one per VM, fenced with `# opencharly:begin` markers) and ensures your `~/.ssh/config` has `Include ~/.config/charly/ssh_config` (also managed). After that, `ssh charly-<vmname>` works from any terminal — and the local deploy path constructs `&SSHExecutor{Host: "charly-<vmname>"}` (via `rootExecutorForDeployNode`) with no User/Port/Key; ssh(1) resolves them from the config.

## Quick Reference

| Action | Command |
|---|---|
| Direct local | `charly bundle add my-laptop` (`host: local` is the default) |
| SSH to remote | `charly bundle add ci-3` with `host: user@ci-3.lan` in charly.yml |
| Reference a template | `from: dev-workstation` inside the `local:` node |
| Tear down | `charly bundle del <name>` |
| Tear down, keep repo changes | `charly bundle del <name> --keep-repo-changes` |

## `host:` destination semantics

A host/remote deploy MUST be authored as the `host:` FIELD on a `local:` deploy — `local: {from: <template>, host: <user@machine>}`. The `host:` field is a SCALAR on the `local:` substrate node; there is NO standalone `host:` venue KIND, and authoring a `host:` node is a hard load error.

Reserved literal: `local`. Anything else (including `localhost`, `127.0.0.1`) goes through SSH.

```yaml
# Each deployment is a name-first deploy: the `local:` substrate kind at
# the edge, `from:` selects the template, and `host:` selects direct shell vs SSH.

# Direct local — host: omitted == "local". add_candy is a list, so it
# lives in its own child node.
my-laptop:
  local:
    from: dev-workstation
  my-laptop-add_candy:
    add_candy: [sshkeys]

# Explicit local sentinel.
my-laptop-explicit:
  local:
    from: dev-workstation
    host: local

# SSH to remote machine (ssh-config + agent supply credentials).
ci-runner-3:
  local:
    from: ci-runner
    host: ubuntu@ci-runner-3.lan

# SSH with explicit port.
bastion:
  local:
    from: dev-workstation
    host: admin@bastion.example.com:2222

# SSH to loopback for testing the SSH path.
ssh-self-test:
  local:
    from: dev-workstation
    host: localhost
```

## `user:` and `ssh_args:` — Ansible-style overrides

Two pass-through fields mirror Ansible's per-host overrides:

```yaml
# Explicit user override (Ansible's ansible_user). Used when host: has
# no "@" prefix. Cleaner than embedding the user in host: when the
# destination is an ssh-config alias. host: and user: are scalars, so
# they sit directly under the substrate kind.
workshop-laptop:
  local:
    from: dev-workstation
    host: workshop-laptop.lan
    user: alice

# ssh_args: passes options through to ssh(1) (Ansible's
# ansible_ssh_extra_args). Use sparingly — ssh-config Host stanzas are
# the right home for persistent options. ssh_args is a list, so it lives
# in its own child node.
via-bastion:
  local:
    from: dev-workstation
    host: target.internal
    user: ops
  via-bastion-ssh_args:
    ssh_args:
      - "-o"
      - "ProxyJump=ops@bastion.example.com"
```

**Precedence rule** for `user:` vs the inline `host: <user>@<machine>` form: the inline user wins (more-specific beats more-general). When both are set with different values, the validator emits an error — pick one. When both are absent, ssh(1) reads the `User` directive from `~/.ssh/config` or falls back to `$USER`.

## Setup: one-time `Include` line

The first `charly vm create` writes:
- A Host stanza into `~/.config/charly/ssh_config` (managed block, fenced).
- An `Include ~/.config/charly/ssh_config` line into your `~/.ssh/config` (also fenced).

If you prefer to manage your `~/.ssh/config` manually, add the Include line yourself before creating any VMs. `charly vm destroy` removes the matching stanza and, when the fragment is empty, removes the Include line too.

## Passwordless sudo on remote SSH targets

Remote `target: local` deploys assume **passwordless sudo** on the destination. We do not bridge interactive sudo prompts through the SSH session. Either: (a) configure `NOPASSWD` for your user on the remote, or (b) restrict the deploy to layers that don't require root (omit `--with-services`, omit packages that need `sudo dnf`).

## Gates (opt-in flags)

| Flag | Guards |
|---|---|
| `--with-services` | systemd unit writes; `systemctl enable --now` |
| `--allow-repo-changes` | `/etc/yum.repos.d/`, `/etc/apt/`, `/etc/pacman.conf` mutations |
| `--allow-root-tasks` | arbitrary `cmd: user: root` task bodies (opaque shell) |
| `--skip-incompatible` | skip candies without a destination-matching format section |
| `--builder-image <ref>` | override the compile builder image |
| `--yes` / `-y` | implies all three gates + skips sudo preflight |

## Validation

`charly box validate` checks every `target: local` deployment:

- `from: <name>` (inside the `local:` node) references a `kind: local` template that exists.
- `host:` field, when non-`local`, parses via `ParseSSHTarget`.
- `user:` and `ssh_args:` only meaningful when `host:` is non-`local` (otherwise error).
- `user:` redundancy: when `host: <inline>@<machine>` and `user:` are both set with different values, error.

## Cross-References

- `/charly-local:local-spec` — author-facing reference for `kind: local` templates.
- `/charly-internals:local-infra` — Go file map for the executor/ledger surface.
- `/charly-core:deploy` — parent command family.
- `/charly-image:layer` — `service:` schema rendered as systemd units on local-target deploys.
- `/charly-vm:vm` — managed ssh-config fragment writen on `charly vm create`.
- `/charly-check:check` — `--verify` re-runs candy `check:` against the deploy post-install.
- `/charly-internals:install-plan` — shared IR consumed by the external `deploy:local` plugin over the executor reverse channel.

## When to Use This Skill

**MUST be invoked** when the task involves `target: local`, the Ansible-style `host:` field, the `user:`/`ssh_args:` overrides, the managed ssh-config fragment, the install ledger, or ReverseOp teardown. Invoke this skill BEFORE reading Go source or launching Explore agents.
