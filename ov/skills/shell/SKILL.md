# Shell - Shell & Execution

## Overview

`ov shell` runs an interactive shell or executes commands inside containers. Supports workspace mounting, device auto-detection, environment injection, and TTY allocation for automation tools.

## Quick Reference

| Action | Command | Description |
|--------|---------|-------------|
| Interactive shell | `ov shell <image>` | Bash shell in container |
| Bind workspace | `ov shell <image> --bind workspace=~/project` | Mount host dir as workspace volume |
| Volume config | `ov shell <image> -v name:type[:path]` | Configure volume backing (volume\|bind\|encrypted) |
| Run command | `ov shell <image> -c "cmd"` | Execute command and exit |
| Force TTY | `ov shell <image> --tty -c "cmd"` | PTY allocation for automation |
| Specific version | `ov shell <image> --tag v1.0.0` | Use specific image tag |
| No devices | `ov shell <image> --no-autodetect` | Disable device auto-detection |
| Set env var | `ov shell <image> -e KEY=VALUE` | Inject environment variable |
| Load env file | `ov shell <image> --env-file .env` | Load env from file |
| Named instance | `ov shell <image> -i runner-1` | Use named instance |
| Force build | `ov shell <image> --build` | Build locally before running |

**Note:** `ov shell` does not accept remote refs (`@github.com/...`). Remote
refs are handled exclusively by `ov image pull` (build-mode). Pull first,
then `ov shell <image-name>` works via labels. See `/ov:pull`.

## How It Works

1. Resolves image from OCI labels via `ExtractMetadata` (never `image.yml`)
2. Applies `deploy.yml` overlay (volumes, env, sidecars, tunnel)
3. Ensures image exists in run engine (transfers from build engine if needed)
4. Resolves volumes (with deploy-time backing), ports, security, environment
5. If container is already running: `<engine> exec` into it
6. If not running: `<engine> run` with full configuration

If the image isn't in local storage, `ExtractMetadata`/`EnsureImage` return
`ErrImageNotLocal` and the CLI surfaces:
```
Error: image "X" is not available locally.
       Run 'ov image pull X' to fetch it first
```
See `/ov:pull` for the full sentinel pattern.

## Volume Binding

```bash
ov shell <image> --bind workspace=~/project  # Bind ~/project as workspace volume
ov shell <image> --bind workspace=.          # Bind PWD as workspace volume
ov shell <image>                             # No host mount (named volume)
```

The `--bind` flag overrides volume backing for the session. For finer control, use `-v name:type[:path]` where type is `volume`, `bind`, or `encrypted`. The container working directory is `~/workspace` (resolved from the `workspace` volume). If a `.env` file exists in the bound directory, it is auto-loaded.

## --tty Flag

Forces TTY allocation even when stdout is not a terminal. Uses `script(1)` from util-linux to provide a real PTY.

```bash
# Without --tty: "not a tty" errors from interactive commands
ov shell my-app -c "interactive-cli auth login"       # fails in CI/automation

# With --tty: script(1) wraps the command in a PTY
ov shell my-app --tty -c "interactive-cli auth login"  # works everywhere
```

Essential for automation tools (Claude Code, CI runners) where stdout is a pipe, not a terminal. Many interactive CLI commands (OAuth flows, prompts) require a TTY.

Works for both new containers (`<engine> run`) and exec into running containers (`<engine> exec`).

## Exec Into Running Containers

When `ov shell` detects the container is already running (via `<engine> inspect`), it uses `<engine> exec` instead of `<engine> run`. The same flags work:

```bash
ov start my-app                            # Start background service
ov shell my-app -c "cat /etc/hostname"     # Exec into running container
ov shell my-app                            # Interactive shell in running container
```

## Port Relay

The `port_relay` field in layer.yml solves the problem of services that bind only to 127.0.0.1 inside the container (e.g., Chrome 146+ DevTools). Container port mappings only forward to interfaces visible from outside, so a loopback-only service is unreachable from the host.

```yaml
# In layer.yml:
port_relay:
  - 9222
```

How it works:
- socat binds to `eth0:<port>` and forwards to `127.0.0.1:<port>`
- An init system service is auto-generated (via build.yml `init.<name>.relay_template`) with priority 1 (starts before other services)
- The socat layer is automatically added as a dependency

This makes loopback-only services accessible through normal podman/docker port mappings and `tailscale serve`.

Source: `ov/generate.go` (relay service generation), `ov/layers.go` (`PortRelayYAML`).

## Device Auto-Detection

By default, `ov shell` auto-detects available host devices and passes them through. Use `--no-autodetect` to disable.

**Auto-detected devices:**
- NVIDIA GPU (via `nvidia-smi`) -- `--gpus all` (Docker) or `--device nvidia.com/gpu=all` (Podman)
- AMD GPU (via sysfs `amdgpu` driver) -- `--device /dev/kfd` + `--group-add keep-groups` + auto-detected `HSA_OVERRIDE_GFX_VERSION` from KFD topology
- `/dev/dri/renderD*` -- GPU render nodes
- `/dev/kfd` -- AMD Kernel Fusion Driver (ROCm compute)
- `/dev/kvm` -- KVM virtualization
- `/dev/vhost-net`, `/dev/vhost-vsock` -- virtio networking
- `/dev/fuse` -- FUSE filesystem
- `/dev/net/tun` -- TUN/TAP networking
- `/dev/hwrng` -- hardware RNG

When an AMD GPU is detected, `keep-groups` is auto-added to preserve host supplementary groups (video, render) inside the container, and `HSA_OVERRIDE_GFX_VERSION` is auto-set from the GPU's KFD topology (e.g., `10.3.0` for RDNA2). Additionally, the first detected `/dev/dri/renderD*` device is auto-injected as `DRINODE` and `DRI_NODE` env vars (used by selkies for VAAPI encoding). All auto-detected env vars can be overridden via `-e`.

**Shared code path:** `ov shell` calls `appendAutoDetectedEnv()` in `ov/devices.go` — the same function used by `ov config` and `ov start`. That means the three commands produce an identical env set on every run, eliminating drift that used to exist when DRINODE injection was scattered across 10 different call sites before commit `8f6f322`. See `/ov:doctor` (Hardware Detection) for the probe side, `/ov-layers:nvidia` (DRINODE Auto-Injection) for the NVIDIA consumer, and `/ov-layers:rocm` (Runtime Environment) for the AMD consumer.

Source: `ov/devices.go` (`DetectHostDevices`, `DetectGPU`, `DetectAMDGPU`, `appendAutoDetectedEnv`).

## Environment Variables

Runtime environment variables are injected from multiple sources. Resolution priority (last wins for duplicate keys):

1. **Deploy config `env:`** (image.yml / deploy.yml) -- lowest priority
2. **Deploy config `env_file:`** (image.yml / deploy.yml)
3. **Workspace `.env`** file -- auto-loaded from `-w` directory
4. **CLI `--env-file`** flag
5. **CLI `-e`** flags -- highest priority

```bash
ov shell <image> -e DB_HOST=localhost -e DB_PORT=5432
ov shell <image> --env-file production.env
```

Kong `sep:"none"` on `-e` means commas in values are safe (e.g., `NO_PROXY=localhost,127.0.0.1`).

`.env` file format (Docker-compatible): `KEY=VALUE`, `KEY="VALUE"`, `KEY='VALUE'`, `KEY` (inherits from host), `#` comments, blank lines ignored.

Source: `ov/envfile.go` (`ParseEnvFile`, `ResolveEnvVars`, `LoadWorkspaceEnv`).

## Remote Image References

`ov shell` **does not** accept `@github.com/...` remote refs. Pre-refactor
versions did; post-refactor, deploy-mode commands read only from local OCI
labels, so remote refs are rejected with a redirect:

```
Error: remote refs are not accepted here;
       run 'ov image pull @github.com/org/repo/my-app' first,
       then 'ov shell my-app'
```

To run a shell on a remote image, pull it first (via `ov image pull`) and
then invoke `ov shell <short-name>`. See `/ov:pull` for the full remote-ref
workflow.

## Cross-Engine Image Transfer

When `engine.build` differs from `engine.run`, images are automatically transferred between engines on demand via `<src> save | <dst> load`.

Source: `ov/transfer.go`.

## Container Networking

All containers are connected to a shared `ov` network by default, enabling inter-container DNS resolution by container name. Override with `network: host` in image.yml.

Source: `ov/network.go`.

## `ov cmd` vs `ov shell -c`

`ov cmd <image> "command"` is a dedicated single-command tool for **running containers only**. Key differences from `ov shell -c`:

| | `ov cmd` | `ov shell -c` |
|---|---------|--------------|
| Container state | Running only | Running or starts new |
| Notification | Yes (`--[no-]notify`) | No |
| Process model | `exec.Command` (returns) | `syscall.Exec` (replaces) |
| Workspace mount | No | Yes (`-w`) |
| Device auto-detect | No | Yes |
| Use case | Quick commands + notification | Full container setup + command |

Use `ov cmd` for quick operations on running services. Use `ov shell -c` when you need workspace mounts, device passthrough, or need to start a new container.

## Cross-References

### Prerequisite

- `/ov:pull` -- **Required** before `ov shell` can work on a fresh host. Fetches the image into local storage so `ExtractMetadata` can read its OCI labels. Handles remote refs (`@github.com/...`) that `ov shell` itself rejects.

### Deploy-mode neighbors

- `/ov:cmd` -- Single command execution with D-Bus notification (running containers only)
- `/ov:tmux` -- Persistent tmux sessions (survives disconnects, needed for TTY-dependent TUI programs)
- `/ov:service` -- Starting background services before exec
- `/ov:start` -- Same `appendAutoDetectedEnv()` injection at service-start time
- `/ov:config` -- Deployment setup + same `appendAutoDetectedEnv()` at deploy time; `--no-autodetect` flag disables it
- `/ov:deploy` -- `deploy.yml` overlay applied to labels before shell spawns
- `/ov:cdp` -- Chrome DevTools Protocol automation
- `/ov:wl` (sway subgroup) -- Sway compositor control
- `/ov:doctor` -- Host hardware probe that feeds `appendAutoDetectedEnv()` (DRINODE, HSA_OVERRIDE_GFX_VERSION)
- `/ov:settings` -- Engine and bind address settings

### Build-mode references

- `/ov:image` -- Image definitions (ports, volumes, env) in `image.yml`; authoritative source before a pull
- `/ov:build` -- Build the image you intend to shell into

### Layer skills

- `/ov-layers:nvidia`, `/ov-layers:rocm` -- GPU layers consuming the auto-injected env

## When to Use This Skill

**MUST be invoked** when the task involves ov shell command, interactive shells, command execution in containers, workspace mounts, TTY allocation, or port relay. Invoke this skill BEFORE reading source code or launching Explore agents.

**Workflow position:** Any time. Interactive access to running or stopped containers.
