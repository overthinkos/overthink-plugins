# hermes-playwright

Hermes AI agent with Playwright Chromium — web scraping, browser automation, and all headless agent capabilities.

## Image Properties

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| Base | fedora |
| Layers | agent-forwarding, hermes, hermes-playwright, dbus, charly |
| Platforms | linux/amd64 |
| Security | shm_size: 1g |
| Registry | ghcr.io/overthinkos |

## Full Layer Stack

Builds on the base `hermes` layer (not the hermes image), adding Playwright Chromium:

1. `fedora` base + `agent-forwarding` + `hermes` + `hermes-playwright` + `dbus` + `charly`
2. `hermes-playwright` -- Playwright npm package + Chromium Headless Shell + system deps

## Quick Start

```bash
charly box build hermes-playwright
charly config hermes-playwright -e OLLAMA_API_KEY=your-key   # or OPENROUTER_API_KEY
charly start hermes-playwright
```

The hermes entrypoint performs single-phase, first-start-only auto-configuration of LLM providers and MCP servers from env vars. See `/charly-hermes:hermes` for full provider configuration and MCP auto-discovery details.

## Playwright Usage

### From Node.js
```bash
charly shell hermes-playwright -c "NODE_PATH=~/.npm-global/lib/node_modules node -e \"
const { chromium } = require('playwright');
(async () => {
  const browser = await chromium.launch({ headless: true });
  const page = await browser.newPage();
  await page.goto('https://example.com');
  console.log(await page.title());
  await browser.close();
})();
\""
```

### Via npx CLI
```bash
charly shell hermes-playwright -c "npx playwright --version"
```

## Key Layers

- `/charly-hermes:hermes` -- core agent (inherited)
- `/charly-hermes:hermes-playwright` -- Playwright + Chromium + system deps

## Fedora Compatibility Note

Playwright's `--with-deps` flag does not support Fedora (falls back to Ubuntu's `apt-get`). The `hermes-playwright` layer works around this by:
1. Installing Chromium's system library dependencies via rpm packages in `candy.yml`
2. Installing only the browser binary via `npx playwright install chromium` in `task:`

The `PLAYWRIGHT_BROWSERS_PATH=/tmp/.cache/ms-playwright` env var is set automatically.

## Verification

After `charly start`:
```bash
charly status hermes-playwright               # container running
charly service status hermes-playwright        # all services RUNNING
charly shell hermes-playwright -c "hermes --version"
charly shell hermes-playwright -c "npx playwright --version"
# Full browser launch test:
charly shell hermes-playwright -c "NODE_PATH=~/.npm-global/lib/node_modules node -e \"
const { chromium } = require('playwright');
(async () => {
  const b = await chromium.launch({ headless: true });
  const p = await b.newPage();
  await p.goto('https://example.com');
  console.log('Title:', await p.title());
  await b.close();
  console.log('OK');
})();

## When to Use This Skill

**MUST be invoked** when the task involves the hermes-playwright image, Hermes Agent with browser automation, or deploying hermes with Playwright. Invoke this skill BEFORE reading source code or launching Explore agents.
