# Check — unified declarative + AI-iteration evaluation

## kind: check beds + `charly check run <bed>` — config-driven R10 acceptance

The disposable R10 test beds are **`kind: check` entities in the `check:` block
of the project `charly.yml`**. A
`kind: check` entity is a deploy-shaped node folded into the Deploy map at load
time, so every deploy verb resolves it by name; `charly check run <bed>` drives the
full R10 sequence on it:

This is the **ecosystem-wide** rule: every repo-shipped disposable test bed —
the main repo's beds AND every `box/<distro>` submodule's beds (the arch /
cachyos / debian / ubuntu / fedora bootstrap-VM and pacstrap/debootstrap beds) —
is a `kind: check` entity, in that repo's config (its `charly.yml` + per-kind sibling files). Repos
ship NO `kind: deploy` test beds. The lone `kind: deploy` exception is an
operator profile, not a test bed (the cachyos submodule's `charly-cachyos`
workstation profile); operator deployments otherwise live in the per-host
`~/.config/charly/charly.yml`. `disposable: true` is the sole authorization for the
unattended destroy + rebuild on any of them.

A bed is a **candybox** (CLAUDE.md "Candyboxing"): a disposable, secured
container / VM stocked with the FULL toolset — the entire `charly check` probe surface
(cdp/wl/dbus/vnc/mcp/adb/appium/k8s), nested podman, real package managers, the
whole layer/image library — so the AI can build, deploy, and prove the *real*
composition inside it (the substance of RDD), and `disposable: true` makes
tearing it down and rebuilding fearless. The box is restricted at the boundary,
never by stripping the candy.

1. `charly box build <image> --dev-local-pkg` — build the test artifact (pod beds only). The check-bed runner sets `--dev-local-pkg` AUTOMATICALLY, so a bed bakes the **in-development** charly toolchain (any `localpkg:` candy built from local source) — never a stale published release. A bed thus always tests the code under development; a production box build downloads the released package. See `/charly-tools:charly` "Check-vs-production binary source" + `/charly-internals:install-plan` "Check-vs-production charly toolchain".
2. `charly check box <image>` — box-section + baked candy-section probes.
3. `charly deploy add <bed> <ref>` — apply the bed (or `charly vm create` for vm beds).
4. (pod beds) `charly config <bed>` + `charly start <bed>`.
5. `charly check live <bed>` — full three-section live probe pass.
6. `charly update <bed>` — fresh-rebuild re-verification (R10 acceptance gate).
7. `charly remove <bed>` (or `charly vm destroy`) — leave the host clean.

**The bed tests the LATEST LOCAL candies — not the pinned remote.** Step 1 also
points a bed's parent-repo `@github.com/<org>/<parent>/candy/...:<tag>` candy refs
at the LOCAL superproject working tree — the candy-ref analogue of the auto
`--dev-local-pkg` toolchain build above. `runCheckBed` auto-appends a
`CHARLY_REPO_OVERRIDE` for the bed project's OWN superproject (detected via `git
rev-parse --show-superproject-working-tree`; the ref's `:vTAG` is ignored, so the
bed always builds the dev's current tree). So a `box/<distro>` submodule bed —
which pulls main's shared candies via `@github` refs — verifies the IN-DEVELOPMENT
candy tree; without this it would build the STALE pinned remote candy and serve no
purpose. An explicit operator `CHARLY_REPO_OVERRIDE` entry for the same repo still
wins (it is placed first). A bed whose project is its own root needs no override —
its candies already resolve from the local tree. Source:
`selfSuperprojectOverridePair` + `mergeRepoOverrides` (`charly/refs.go`), applied
in `runCheckBed` (`charly/check_bed_run.go`); the underlying `CHARLY_REPO_OVERRIDE`
is the Go-`replace`-style "verify before you push" mechanism.

**Exclusive-resource preemption wraps the sequence.** When a bed declares
`requires_exclusive: [token...]` (e.g. a GPU-passthrough bed needing the one
physical card), `runCheckBed` acquires a resource-arbitration lease BEFORE step 1
and `defer`-releases it after teardown: any running `preemptible` holder of the
token (e.g. the operator's GPU workstation VM) is gracefully stopped — and the
arbiter waits until it actually powers off so the device is freed — then restored
when the bed finishes (even on failure, for `restore: always`). A holder is never
left stopped: `charly preempt status` / `charly preempt restore` recover a crashed run.
Triggering this — running a `requires_exclusive:` bed that stops the operator's
`preemptible` GPU holder — is STANDING-authorized (no per-run confirmation): it is
reversible by design (graceful stop + guaranteed restore), not a destroy.
See `/charly-internals:disposable` "The resource-arbitration axis" + `/charly-core:deploy`.

**A GPU bed runs on a passthrough host where host `nvidia-smi` FAILS — that is the
READY state, not a blocker.** A `requires_exclusive: [nvidia-gpu]` bed needs the card
bound to the `vfio-pci` host driver so the guest VM can claim it via VFIO; host-side
`nvidia-smi` / `rocm-smi` failing is therefore EXPECTED and does NOT mean the bed
can't run — the GPU comes alive INSIDE the guest. Gauge readiness with `charly vm gpu
status` (or `charly vm gpu list` / `lspci -nnk` → `Kernel driver in use: vfio-pci`),
NEVER host `nvidia-smi`. See `/charly-vm:vm` "GPU passthrough (VFIO)".

A `requires_shared: [nvidia-gpu]` bed (a GPU CDI pod) makes the arbiter flip the
WHOLE IOMMU group vfio→nvidia at deploy and back nvidia→vfio at teardown — the
group-aware, `modprobe -r`-gated switch (`charly vm gpu mode`/`status`/`recover`).
NEVER manually sysfs-`unbind` a busy nvidia to "free" a card between bed runs:
that hangs the kernel `device_lock` (reboot-only). If a card shows wedged/poisoned
in `charly vm gpu status`, a host reboot is required; the arbiter refuses a poisoned
token until then. Full model + RCA: `/charly-vm:vm` "GPU driver-mode switch" +
`/charly-internals:disposable` "resource-arbitration axis".

`charly check run --all-beds` runs every bed name-sorted. Flags: `--keep` (don't
tear down), `--no-rebuild` (skip step 6) — both scope-shrinking, governed by
"Flag discipline" below. Per-run logs land in
`.check/<bed>/<calver>/` (per-step `.log` files + `summary.yml`).

### Flag discipline — the `iterate:`/bed config IS the test specification

The `iterate:` / `kind: check` config in the project's `check:` block IS the
test spec; the operator authorizes overrides, not Claude. Passing ANY
scope-shrinking flag to `charly check run` (or `charly check live`) without the user
explicitly naming that flag in the SAME conversation turn is the same fraud
class as dry-run-as-R10 (CLAUDE.md R10 flag-override clause). The catalog:
`--plateau-iteration`, `--max-scenario`, `--tag`, `--skip-rebuild`,
`--on-pod` / `--on-vm` / `--on-host`, `--keep-repo`, `--dry-run`, and the bed
flags `--no-rebuild` (skips the R10 fresh-rebuild gate) and `--keep`.
(`--all-beds` is scope-EXPANDING, not shrinking: it is in-spec WITHOUT
authorization when "R10 gate by change class" mandates it for a cross-cutting
change, and needs authorization only as a SUBSTITUTE for the class-mandated
gate.) Internal-voice triggers — "tractable wall-clock", "for the
canary", "to fit session bounds", "shorten this run", "skip the heavy leg",
"faster iteration cycle" — are confessions, not defences. The `iterate:`
block's `plateau_iteration` and the AI's `progress_no_improvement_timeout` together
define the AI's recovery budget per phase; narrow neither without explicit
authorization. Speed levers that do NOT shrink scope (e.g. `--podman-jobs`, `--jobs`) need
no authorization — the lever catalog is `/charly-internals:agents` "Speed
levers".

**Run retention (`defaults.keep_check_runs`).** After `charly check run` (any path —
bed / `--all-beds` / `iterate:` entity), `.check/<name>/` is trimmed to the newest N run
artifacts (CalVer run dirs, `runs/<id>/` dirs, `result-<calver>.yml`) so harness
output doesn't accumulate unbounded. `NOTES.md` (the durable Syncthing-replicated
memory) is ALWAYS preserved. Set `defaults.keep_check_runs` in `charly.yml`
(`0`/absent disables); apply on demand with `charly clean --check`. See
`/charly-core:clean`.

### The ecosystem's `kind: check` beds

| Bed | Target | Ref | Surface |
|---|---|---|---|
| `check-sway-browser-vnc-pod` | pod | `box: sway-browser-vnc` | cdp/wl/vnc/dbus/mcp/record + pod-side file/service/port/process/http |
| `check-k3s-vm` | vm | `vm: k3s-vm` | k8s (all 13 methods) + guest-side file/service/port/process, http via port-forward, VmDeployTarget end-to-end |
| `check-pod` | pod | `box: check-pod` | combined mechanism bed: `kind: box` build + `kind: candy` composition order + `kind: pod` runtime (nc :18794 + supervisord) + every DeployTarget rendering path |
| `check-local` | local | `local: check-local` | `kind: local` layer apply via ShellExecutor |
| `check-jupyter-pod` | pod | `box: jupyter` | jupyter-mcp regression coverage |
| `check-jupyter-ml-pod` | pod | `box: jupyter-ml` | jupyter-ml spacy/quarto + GPU MCP probes |
| `check-versa-pod` | pod | `box: versa` | versa OSM analytics + vector-tile + marimo MCP |
| `check-android-emulator-pod` | pod | `box: android-emulator` | Android 14 emulator (/dev/kvm) + adb/appium |
| `check-charly-vm` | vm | `vm: charly-vm` | `charly` toolchain localpkg deploy witness (opencharly-git pacman install + dep auto-resolve) on the cloud VM |

Bed HOMES: the main repo's `charly.yml` owns `check-k3s-vm`, `check-local`, and
`check-charly-vm`; the pod beds above live in the `box/<distro>` submodules'
`check:` blocks (`check-pod`, `check-jupyter-pod`, `check-jupyter-ml-pod`,
`check-sway-browser-vnc-pod` in `box/fedora`; `check-versa-pod`,
`check-android-emulator-pod` in `box/cachyos`) and run from that submodule
(e.g. `charly -C box/fedora check run check-pod`).

Naming: `check-<descriptor>-<kind>`, dropping a redundant suffix when the
descriptor already equals the kind AND the short form is free (`check-local`,
`check-pod`). The harness AI-sandbox pod (the `iterate:` block's `sandbox:`
target) is named
`check-sandbox`, kept disjoint from these beds. Nothing in the `charly` Go code
hardcodes that name — it flows from the `iterate.sandbox:` field through
`ResolveIterateSandbox`, and prompts reference it via the `${TARGET_NAME}`
substitution token. **The sandbox is an OPERATOR-PROVISIONED per-host
deploy** — the runner restarts-but-never-creates it: provision once with
`charly deploy add check-sandbox <ref> --disposable` + `charly start
check-sandbox` (the ref must provide charly + nested podman + the configured
AI CLI; the per-host overlay never ships with the repo). On a host without
the entry, `charly check run <bed>` fails fast with exactly that
remediation. The supporting
`vm: k3s-vm` + `k8s: vm-k3s-vm` entities live in the project `charly.yml`
alongside its beds. `disposable: true` is the sole authorization
for the unattended destroy+rebuild (see `/charly-internals:disposable`). Two
load-time guards back the beds: `validateCheckBeds` enforces `target ∈ {pod, vm,
local, android}`, a resolvable cross-ref, and `disposable: true`; `foldCheckBeds`
enforces the name-disjointness from `kind: deploy`. Neither checks host ports —
disjoint ports across beds are the AUTHOR's responsibility (an overlap fails the
second bed at deploy via `CheckPortAvailability`).

### Approximate wall-clock (10-CPU 32-GB reference host)

`check-pod` ~110s (one build → deploy → check → fresh-update → teardown cycle
covering all four mechanisms) · `check-local` ~45s · `check-k3s-vm` ~5–7 min · the
heavy feature beds (`check-sway-browser-vnc-pod` ~14 min incl. image build)
longer. **`charly check run --all-beds` runs beds STRICTLY SEQUENTIALLY (a plain loop
— no concurrency in `charly`), so its wall-clock ≈ the SUM.** To collapse that to ≈
the slowest single bed, parallelize at the AGENT layer — one agent/teammate per
bed, N concurrent `charly check run <bed>` processes (`/verify-beds` and an agent team
both do this; see `/charly-internals:agents` "Speed levers"). The dominant cost is
the step-1 `charly box build`: a pod bed builds the image ONCE — the "fresh
`charly update`" R10 step is a `systemctl restart` onto the already-built image, not
a second build — and same-base beds share cached layers, so pre-warming a shared
base once makes every sibling bed's build incremental.

**Handling a long-running bed — by mechanism, not by who owns it.** A VM/emulator
bed's `charly check run` orchestrator runs for minutes-to-tens-of-minutes AND the
libvirt domain / emulator it spawns outlives a single turn. (1) **Launch it as a
harness-tracked background task** (`run_in_background`) — never foreground (the
Bash tool's `timeout`, 120s default / 600s max, kills the call mid-`vm-create`,
orphaning the domain) and
never a sleep/poll loop (the R4 bandaid). (2) **Let the completion notification
drive the next step** — the harness re-invokes the LAUNCHING session when the run
exits, so the launcher must SURVIVE to completion to be notified: the persistent
main session does; an ephemeral sub-agent (returns synchronously) and an idle
teammate (torn down on idle) do NOT, and orphan the bed. EVERY full `charly check run <bed>`
is a `run_in_background` task owned by a PERSISTENT owner that survives across
turns to be notified — the main session, a background agent, or (interactive
tmux) a split-pane teammate; an in-process teammate CANNOT. Duration-independent;
the 600s is a Bash FOREGROUND cap, irrelevant to a backgrounded bed.
Teammates/sub-agents do bed-local edits + short foreground checks (`charly check
image`), never the full run. (3) **Reconnect via durable state** —
`.check/<bed>/<calver>/summary.yml` + the live domain ARE the truth: "done" =
summary.yml present; "alive" = the orchestrator is in the process table; clean up
an orphan (`running` domain, no live orchestrator) with `charly vm destroy <entity>`
(or `charly remove <name>` for a pod) before re-running. See `/charly-internals:agents` "The binding rule".

### Prereq for the vm bed

`check-k3s-vm` depends on the **libvirt user-session daemon**. Enable once:

```bash
systemctl --user enable --now virtqemud.service     # libvirt >= 8 (modular)
# OR (older monolithic):
systemctl --user enable --now libvirtd.service
```

(The host libvirt daemon is host infrastructure, not a charly-managed
resource — enabling it via systemctl sits outside the charly-CLI-only
mandate's scope.)

`charly check run check-k3s-vm` best-effort starts the unit before `charly vm create`
(via `startLibvirtUserSession()` in `charly/vm.go`), and `resolveVmBackend()` now
spawns it too **before** probing the socket — so a cold socket is never mistaken
for "libvirt absent" (Arch/CachyOS ship no persistent `virtqemud.socket`; the
socket appears only after an autospawn). **Never gauge libvirt readiness with
`systemctl is-active virtqemud.service`** — a socket-activated / autospawn daemon
reports the service `inactive` while libvirt works fine; check the socket
(`$XDG_RUNTIME_DIR/libvirt/virtqemud-sock`) or `virsh -c qemu:///session list`
instead. `resolveVmBackend()` surfaces
a clear error when libvirt is absent. The `k3s-vm:` vm template pins
`backend: libvirt` explicitly so the silent `auto -> qemu` fallback can't mask
a missing daemon. See `/charly-vm:vm` "Prereq", `/charly-check:libvirt`.

### Why this is config-driven

Beds are `kind: check` config; the runner reads the bed node directly. This
means the runner works for ANY bed an operator defines — `charly check run <name>`
resolves the bed by name through the same path every deploy verb uses, with no
hardcoded bed table to keep in sync.

## R10 gate by change class — pick the gate that exercises the change

The R10 principle is EXERCISE, not ceremony: a gate that cannot fail on the
change proves nothing (wasted verification), and a change whose gate never
executed is unproven (the fraud class CLAUDE.md R10 bans). Pick the SMALLEST
gate that genuinely exercises every changed code path — and run it in full.
CLAUDE.md R10 carries the mandate; this matrix is the authoritative detail.

| Change class | Pre-flight | The R10 gate | Tier on a clean pass | Explicitly NOT required |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Documentation-only change class** — `*.md` (CLAUDE.md, `plugins/**/SKILL.md`, READMEs, CHANGELOG), comment-only code edits, or a submodule pointer bump to an all-documentation submodule commit; zero behavior change | markdown integrity, link checks | The non-runtime standards: adversarial consistency review, the R5 grep self-test, cross-reference validation, the `pre-commit-gate.sh`/`pre-push-gate.sh` gates | `documentation reviewed` | ANY bed run or image build — beds cannot fail on prose |
| **Hook / workflow scripts** — `.claude/hooks/*.sh`, `.claude/workflows/*.js` | `bash -n` / async-body parse | Execute the changed script live: run the hook directly (paste its output); a workflow whose CONTROL FLOW changed runs against ONE bed matching the change. Prompt-string-only workflow edits: parse + the non-runtime standards | `fully tested and validated` | The full bed fan-out |
| **`charly` Go code** | `go test ./...` + `go vet` + `task build:charly` (R9 freshness + `charly version` check) | `charly check run <bed>` for EACH bed whose kind matches a touched code path: box/candy/pod/DeployTarget mechanism → `check-pod`; `target: local` → `check-local`; VM / k8s → `check-k3s-vm`; a feature surface → its feature bed. Cross-cutting loader / resolver / IR / unified-schema changes → `--all-beds` (in-spec for that class, not a scope override) | `fully tested and validated` | Beds whose substrate the change cannot reach |
| **Candy / box / pod / vm / k8s / local / android config** | `charly box validate` | Build + run a bed that COMPOSES the changed entity (a candy edit → a bed whose image stacks that candy); when no bed composes it, the R7 sequence on a disposable deploy: build → `charly check box` → deploy → `charly check live` → fresh `charly update` | `fully tested and validated` | Beds that do not compose the changed entity |
| **`iterate:` / ai check config** | `charly box validate` | The affected `iterate:` bed run AS SPECIFIED (see "Flag discipline") | `fully tested and validated` | Unrelated beds |

**Tier on a clean pass — the class fixes the gate; the gate fixes the tier.**
Passing a class's full gate earns the tier in that column. `analysed on a live
system` and `syntax check only` are partial-completion WAYPOINTS for the RUNTIME
classes only — a live invocation ran but no fresh-rebuild R10 → `analysed on a
live system`; only compile / validate / dry-run ran → `syntax check only` (which
FORBIDS commit). The Documentation-only change class has no live runner, so it
has no waypoint: its non-runtime standards either all pass (→ `documentation
reviewed`) or the change is not ready. The tier DEFINITIONS live in CLAUDE.md
"AI Attribution"; this column names which tier each gate earns, it does not
redefine them.

Mixed changes take the UNION of their classes' gates (docs ride along with the
code class in the same commit, at that code class's runtime tier — never
`documentation reviewed`). Class assignment is honest, not aspirational:
a "comment" edit that changes a prompt string an agent executes is
script-text, not docs; a YAML comment is docs, but a YAML field is config. A
submodule pointer bump is documentation only when the bumped submodule commit is
itself all-documentation (`pre-commit-gate.sh` recurses into its `old..new` diff);
a bump integrating submodule code is a code class, at a runtime tier.

## The 10 Testing Standards (READ FIRST — referenced by CLAUDE.md R1–R10)

An earlier agent claimed "cutover complete, all tests pass" after green `go test ./...` runs, then built an image that crash-looped at startup because a Containerfile stage was silently dropped. The unit tests didn't notice — they only exercised YAML loaders. **Unit tests are NOT a substitute for running the service.**

These are the 10 standards referenced in CLAUDE.md's AI attribution tier ("fully tested and validated"). Each is keyed to a CLAUDE.md R-rule. Apply them whenever a change could affect Containerfile generation, OCI labels, init systems, service startup, or deploy code.

0. **Prove every HIGH-RISK assumption BEFORE you edit (RDD — Risk Driven Development)** — the proactive bookend to Standard 10's fresh-rebuild gate. Low-risk orientation ("what does layer X do") is a skill lookup (R0, zero risk); every high-risk assumption — including any a skill or the code merely *asserts*, and above all whether this layer composition at its latest available versions builds / deploys / runs TOGETHER — is proven on a `disposable: true` bed FIRST (`charly check` it). Never accept docs or code as ground truth for a high-risk decision; if the bed disagrees with a skill, the skill is stale — fix it. Standard 0 (validate forward, riskiest-first) and Standard 10 (re-verify on a fresh rebuild) are the two ends of the same loop.

1. **Build a real artifact** (R7) — `charly box build <image>` / `go build` / `charly vm build <vm>`. Not just `go test`. Not just `charly box generate`.
2. **Verify the emitted artifact's content** (R8) — `grep -c supervisord-conf .build/<image>/Containerfile` for any image that uses supervisord; `charly check libvirt domain-xml <vm>` for a VM.
3. **Verify critical OCI / capability labels post-build** (R8) — `charly box labels <ref> --format init` (or any `ai.opencharly.<key>` shorthand) prints the BUILT ref's label and exits non-zero when absent; `charly box labels <ref>` lists the whole capability contract (`/charly-internals:capabilities`). Empty / missing label → the detection path silently returned nil → regression.
4. **Deploy to a DISPOSABLE target** (R10) — NEVER experiment on a resource that doesn't carry `disposable: true`. If no suitable disposable target exists, create one first (`charly deploy add <name> <ref> --disposable` or mark a VM in vm.yml and `charly vm create`). The setup is part of the task. On a disposable target: `charly update <name>` (unattended). On anything else: confirm with the user before any irreversible destroy — EXCEPT preempting a declared-`preemptible:` holder, which is standing-authorized (reversible: graceful stop + guaranteed restore).
5. **Target must reach steady-state** — `charly status <image>` → `running`; `charly check libvirt info <vm>` → state `running`; SPICE socket file exists and accepts a handshake. If the service start-limit is hit, the container is crashing — read `charly logs <image>` and reproduce in a disposable shell (`charly shell <image>`, running the service command manually).
6. **Run the declarative test suite** — `charly check live <image>` full three-section pass against the live container (or `--uri` / `--host` remote equivalent for a remote target).
7. **Verify the deployed binary is the one you built** (R9) — `charly version` on the target matches the expected CalVer, and `charly status <image>` (detail `Image ref:` line; JSON `image_ref`) shows the running container's image ref carries THIS build's CalVer tag, not the prior one. Source-only changes (Syncthing, git push) do NOT update the deployed binary; you must build AND deploy on the target host.
8. **Verify runtime deps are installed via package management** (R9) — on the HOST: `charly doctor` (dependency status), or the host package manager directly (`rpm -q <pkg>` / `pacman -Q <pkg>` — host packages are not charly-managed resources, so the package manager IS their interface); inside a container: `charly cmd <box> 'rpm -q <pkg>'`. Manual installs do NOT count — they won't survive a fresh install on a synced host. Every runtime dep must live in `setup.sh` + `pkg/arch/PKGBUILD`.
9. **Leave the target healthy, not paused/errored** — the final `charly status` (and `charly check libvirt info <vm>` for a VM) is healthy. If the target is in a broken state during exploration, `charly update` it back to the committed config before continuing — never layer experiments on broken state.
10. **Re-verify on a FRESH rebuild after committing the source-level fix** (R10) — `charly update <disposable-target>` one more time from clean, with the new source applied. Run standards 1–9 again against this fresh rebuild. **THIS IS THE ACCEPTANCE GATE.** A fix that works on a hand-patched target but not on a fresh rebuild is a regression waiting for the next unrelated rebuild to wipe your patch. Paste BOTH the exploratory-pass output AND the fresh-rebuild-pass output into the conversation — the user sees both.

### `charly check live parent.child` reaches the actual leaf

`charly check live <parent>.<child>` walks the dotted deployment path through
`ResolveDeployChain` (`charly/deploy_chain.go`) and constructs a multi-hop
`DeployExecutor` chain that lands probes inside the leaf's actual
venue — `command: id` for a pod-in-VM leaf returns the inner pod's user, not
the parent VM's. Live-check and AI-iteration-scoring chain construction go
through the same code path `charly deploy add` uses.
For deeply-nested paths, each segment adds one hop:

```bash
charly check live check-vm                            # → SSHExecutor (1 hop)
charly check live check-vm.inner                      # → SSH + podman exec charly-check-vm_inner (2 hops)
charly check live check-vm.inner.deeper               # → SSH + 2× podman exec (3 hops)
```

Same chain primitive (`NestedExecutor`) used everywhere — `charly deploy
add`, `charly check live`, `charly check run` (AI iteration scoring).

**Exception — a POD leaf nested in a VM delegates its check to the guest.** Because
the host-vantage probes (the protocol verbs cdp/wl/dbus/vnc/mcp, which shell out
to a host `charly check <verb>` subprocess resolving the container on the HOST's
podman; and `${HOST_PORT}` addr/http, resolved via HOST `podman inspect`) cannot
reach a container living in the guest, `charly check live <vm>.<pod>` does NOT
chain-dispatch those per-check (they would SKIP). Instead `runVm` runs
`charly check live <pod>` IN the guest over SSH (`guestNestedCheckCmd` →
`SSHExecutor.RunCapture`), where the nested pod is a DIRECT pod — guest-local
podman, ports on guest localhost, the guest `charly` (installed by
`EnsureCharlyInGuest`) — so cdp/wl/mcp + `${HOST_PORT}` run natively, zero skips.
The guest reads the SAME baked checks from the cp-box'd pod image, so the check
set is identical; the host propagates the guest's report + exit code. A
pod-in-pod or vm-in-vm leaf (no host↔guest container boundary) still uses the
multi-hop chain above. See the per-step `pod:` field below for the symmetric
authoring surface in a bed's `plan:`.

### Specific anti-patterns observed and banned

- **"Unit tests pass → cutover done"** — no. Build + deploy + run + test, every time.
- **"Retested after update → still passing!"** but the pre-update test was against the old running image and the post-update container failed to come up — see the `is not running` error and conclude the update broke it, not that "tests pass in aggregate."
- **"Service start failed, probably a transient"** — no. `A dependency job for X failed` + immediate exit is a real error. Read `charly logs <image>`; `charly shell <image>` reproduces it in a disposable container.
- **"Lifecycle: dev implies disposable"** — no. `disposable: true` is the ONE authorization for autonomous destroy + rebuild. Lifecycle tags are human-facing metadata; they do not authorize anything. See `/charly-internals:disposable`.
- **"This is a dev box so I can just nuke it"** — no. The only authorization for autonomous destroy is the explicit `disposable: true` field on a specific deploy. Everything else requires user confirmation, regardless of hostname.
- **"I tested on the VM I've been patching all afternoon, looks fine"** — incomplete. Run `charly update <disposable-target>` once more from clean and re-verify before claiming success. Without the fresh-rebuild re-verification, your "fix" may be latent on hand-patched state.
- **"I'll test it later / Phase 2"** — no. If the plan said "clean cutover in one PR", don't invent a Phase 2.
- **"The skill/code says so, so I don't need to test it"** — for a HIGH-RISK assumption, no: docs drift and code has bugs; prove it on a disposable bed FIRST (Standard 0). Conversely, do NOT bed-test a LOW-risk orientation fact a skill already states — that's wasted effort. Risk, not documentation status, is the trigger.

If the container needs state that's only available in deploy (volumes, env, tunnel), author the step at `context: [deploy]`. If it needs something at build only (binary path, package presence), author at `context: [build]`. Both contexts must pass for the cutover to be real.

**Confidence tier mapping:** The "fully tested and validated" confidence level in CLAUDE.md's AI-attribution table requires ALL 10 standards met — including Standard 10, the fresh-rebuild re-verification. Anything short of that ships at a lower confidence tier.

## Overview

`charly` ships a goss-inspired declarative testing framework built into the
CLI. Plan steps — each one intent keyword (`run:`/`check:`/`agent-run:`/
`agent-check:`/`include:`) carrying prose, plus an inline Op for `run:`/`check:` —
are authored under a `plan:` list in a candy/box `charly.yml`. They are **baked
into the `ai.opencharly.description` OCI label** (`LabelDescriptionSet`, which
carries the collected `plan:` steps with `candy:`/`box:`/`deploy` origin
annotations) so any pulled image is self-testable without its source repo. A
local `charly.yml` overlay can add steps or override baked ones by `id:`.

The runner resolves **deploy-time variables** (actual host port mappings,
volume backings, env vars, container IP, DNS) at execution time, so a
check written once works unchanged when `charly.yml` remaps ports.

## Quick Reference

| Action | Command | Description |
|--------|---------|-------------|
| Pure-box check (disposable, build-context) | `charly check box <image>` | Candy + box sections only, in `podman run --rm` (no host port mappings, no volumes attached) |
| Live full-stack check (running deployment) | `charly check live <name> [-i instance]` | All three sections run via `podman exec` / SSH / nested chain, with full runtime variable resolution |
| R10 bed (full sequence) | `charly check run <bed>` / `charly check run --all-beds` | Build → check image → deploy → check live → fresh update → tear down on a `kind: check` disposable bed. Canonical R10 gate |
| AI iteration loop | `charly check run <bed>` | Drives an AI through plateau-bounded iterations against a bed carrying an `iterate:` block |
| Validate authored tests at config time | `charly box validate` | Schema, context/variable consistency, id uniqueness |
| Inspect effective spec | `charly box inspect <image>` | JSON includes merged check structure |
| Filter by verb | `charly check live <name> --filter file --filter port` | Repeatable |
| Filter by section | `charly check live <name> --section deploy` | One of: candy / box / deploy |
| Output format | `charly check live <name> --format json\|tap\|text` | Default text |

## Exit codes

`charly check` uses a goss/pytest-style three-way exit convention so automation
(and `charly check run <bed>`) can tell "the thing under test is broken" apart from
"the check couldn't run":

| Code | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `0` | All checks passed. |
| `1` | Command / usage / infra error — bad args, undeclared deploy, container not running, image build/deploy/vm-create failed. The check never produced a pass/fail verdict. |
| `2` | The check RAN and one or more **checks FAILED** (`CheckCheckFailExitCode`). |

`charly check box` / `charly check live` return `2` directly when checks fail.
`charly check run <bed>` propagates `2` when the bed's **check step** (check-image /
check-live) fails on checks, but `1` when an **infra step** (build / deploy /
vm-create) fails — so a broken bed image is distinguishable from a genuine
test failure. `charly check run --all-beds` returns `2` only when *every* failing
bed failed on checks; any infra failure makes it `1`. Implementation:
`CheckFailedError` + `CheckCheckFailExitCode` (charly/check_cmd.go), mapped to the
process exit code in `main()` via `errors.As`.

## Image preflight (host-target runs only)

When `charly check run --on-host <name>` (or any `iterate:` entity whose
sandbox resolves to `TargetKindHost`) dispatches the runner, an image
preflight runs FIRST: walk the bed's `plan:`, collect every
distinct step `pod:` plus the bed's target image, deduplicate, and
ensure each image is present in local podman storage BEFORE handing
off to the host runner.

For each discovered image, the algorithm is:

1. `LocalImageExists(podman, ref)` — short-circuit if already
   present. Idempotent on re-runs.
2. `charly box pull <ref>` — preferred path. Resolves short names via
   `cfg.Images[<name>]`, full registry refs pass-through, remote
   `@github.com/...` refs walk through `ResolveRemoteImage`.
3. `charly box build <name>` — fallback when pull fails AND the
   identifier is a short name resolvable via the project's
   `charly.yml`. Build fallback is local-only; for any non-short
   identifier that fails to pull, the preflight aborts with an
   actionable error.

Failures abort the check BEFORE any plan step runs, so operators see
problems early rather than mid-run.

This is the **only** image-fetch surface in the system: deploys (any
target — `local`, `pod`, `vm`, `k8s`) emit zero image-pull steps. A
`kind: local` template has no `image:` field; image preflight lives on this
verb. Operators with legacy YAML run `charly migrate`. See
`/charly-local:local-spec` "What the deploy does NOT do" and CLAUDE.md
"Deploy fetches NOTHING speculative".

Lives in `charly/check_image_preflight.go`
(`EnsureImagePresent`, `ensureScoreImages`); wired into
`CheckRunCmd.Run` for the `case TargetKindHost:` arm. Pod / VM / k8s
targets carry their own image inside their respective deploy schema
and never trigger the preflight.

## Three primary modes (`charly check box` / `live` / `run`)

The surface is three orthogonal verbs, each named for what it evaluates:

- **`charly check box <image>`** — evaluates the image **artifact** in
  isolation. Spawns a disposable container via `podman run --rm
  <image-ref>` (`ImageExecutor`). Only `check:` steps at
  `context: [build]` run; deploy-context steps are skipped with a clear
  message. The right choice for build-time invariants ("did this
  binary land at this path?", "is this package installed?") where a
  running service would only add noise.

- **`charly check live <name>`** — evaluates a **running deployment**
  (pod / vm / host / k8s; auto-resolved by `<name>` against
  charly.yml). Uses `ContainerExecutor` / `SSHExecutor` /
  `NestedExecutor` (for dotted-path children) + `ResolveCheckVarsRuntime`
  so deploy-context steps see real supervisord state, real
  `HOST_PORT:<N>` mappings (including host-networked containers via
  `HostConfig.NetworkMode` detection), and real in-container env.
  Same dispatcher that powers `charly check live parent.child` for
  pod-in-vm topologies.

- **`charly check run <bed>`** — runs a `kind: check` R10 bed (full
  sequence); when the bed carries an `iterate:` block it instead drives
  an AI runner through plateau-bounded iterations. See "AI
  iteration loop semantics" below.

The mode is **explicit in the verb**; there is no autodetect or
implicit fallback. Choose the mode by picking the right verb.

**Which verb/bed proves what (CLAUDE.md R7):** `charly check box` passes on
zero-content stages too — it is NOT a substitute for the generated-artifact
checks (R8). For the R10 gate, pick the `kind: check` bed whose kind matches
what you changed (`check-pod` for the combined box/candy/pod/DeployTarget
mechanism, `check-local`, `check-k3s-vm`, or a feature bed). `charly check run`
on an `iterate:` bed is the multi-hour AI-iteration benchmark, never a quick
gate — the same verb dispatches by whether the entity carries an `iterate:` block.

The banner after `charly check box` reports the image ref:

```
Image: ghcr.io/overthinkos/fedora-coder:latest
```

The `meta.Box` short-name (from the `ai.opencharly.box` OCI
label) is used by `charly check live` for the `charly-<image>` container-name
lookup — full image refs like `ghcr.io/overthinkos/fedora-coder:latest`
are correctly mapped to `charly-fedora-coder`. Implementation:
`charly/check_cmd.go` `CheckBoxCmd.Run()` and `CheckLiveCmd.Run()`.

## Agent Driven Evaluation (ADE) — `charly box/check feature run` + the agent grader

ADE runs an entity's OWN baked `plan:` (shipped in the
`ai.opencharly.description` OCI label) as acceptance tests. It is named for the
agent that drives the evaluation: an `agent-check:` step is graded by an AI
agent, and the agent's verdicts drive the red→green loop. `charly check box` /
`charly check live` and `charly box/check feature run` read the SAME baked
`plan:` — `charly check box`/`live` run its deterministic `check:` steps, while
`charly box/check feature run` also bind the `agent-check:` (and `agent-run:`)
steps to the agent grader.

### The six-stage loop

| Stage | Who | Command | What |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Specify** | you / an agent | hand-edit the candy's `plan:` (or `charly box set candy.<name>.plan ...`) | Author the `description:` string + `plan:` steps on the CANDY that provides the behaviour (it bakes into every box that composes the candy — R3). |
| **Bind** | author (implicit) | `charly feature pending <entity>` lists the agent-graded steps | Use a `check:` step (inline verb) → deterministic; use an `agent-check:` step (prose) → agent-graded. |
| **Run** | you / CI | `charly box feature run <image>` / `charly check feature run <deployment>` | Execute the plan; per-step pass/fail + grader evidence. |
| **Iterate** | you / an agent | edit + re-run, OR `charly check run <bed>` (an `iterate:` bed) | Drive red→green by hand, or let the plateau-bounded AI loop write the code until the `check:` steps pass. |
| **Bake** | the build | `charly box build` | `description:` + `plan:` bake into `ai.opencharly.description`; runs source-less against a pulled image. |
| **Gate** | R10 | `charly check run <bed>` | Runs the bed image's deterministic `check:` steps — every candy ships them (ADE authoring is mandatory: `charly box validate` requires a non-empty `description:` string and a `plan:` with at least one deterministic `check:` step). The live agent grader via `charly check feature run` stays opt-in. |

### The BIND contract — a step binds to its verifier BY SHAPE

```yaml
description: Dashboard          # plain string: the candy's purpose; first line = summary
plan:                           # the ONE flat operational list
  - check: the page title is Dashboard   # inline verb → DETERMINISTIC
    cdp: eval
    expression: document.title
  - agent-check: the chart looks populated, not empty   # PROSE-ONLY → agent-graded
```

A `check:` step carries an embedded probe verb (`file`/`http`/`command`/`cdp`/
`mcp`/…) and runs that check deterministically. An `agent-check:` step carries
only prose and binds to the agent grader. `charly feature pending` lists every
`agent-run:`/`agent-check:` step so an author sees the agent-graded work.

### The two run verbs

- **`charly box feature run <image>`** — build context. A disposable container
  (`podman run --rm` per check), deterministic `check:` steps only. An
  `agent-check:`/`agent-run:` step has no stable target to probe, so it reports
  unbound (advisory skip; `--strict` fails it). Resolves the image against local
  storage (never `charly.yml`), like `charly check box`.
- **`charly check feature run <deployment>`** — deploy context. Against a running
  image-backed (pod) deployment; deterministic `check:` steps run their checks and
  `agent-check:` steps bind to the **agent grader** (unless `--no-agent`). Flags:
  `-i/--instance`, `--format text|json|tap|junit`, `--tag <expr>`,
  `--agent <name>`, `--timeout <dur>`, `--no-agent`, `--strict`.

Exit codes follow the 0/1/2 convention (a step fail → exit 2 via
`CheckFailedError`; an infra error → 1). No plan baked → a no-op pass.

### The agent grader contract

For a prose-only step (when grading is enabled), the runner spawns the
configured `kind: agent` CLI ONCE (bounded — never the plateau loop), handing it the
entity's `description:`, the step's prose, the live
target name, and the instruction that it MAY probe via `charly cmd <target> …`,
`charly check mcp/cdp/wl <target> …`, `charly status <target>`. The agent returns a
single-line JSON verdict `{"verdict":"pass|fail","evidence":"…"}`; the runner
parses it (plain or `stream-json`) into a pass/fail with evidence. An
unparseable / timed-out / launch-failed grader is a **FAIL** with the raw output
— never a silent pass. The grader wall-clock cap is `--timeout` → the ai entry's
`timeout:` → a 5m default. Which agent: `--agent <name>` → the sole configured `agent:`
entry → an explicit "specify --agent" error.

`--no-agent` is the deterministic-only mode (CI): `agent-check:` steps report
`unbound` (visible, never silently green). The unattended `charly check run <bed>`
gate runs `charly check feature run <bed> --no-agent` so a bed stays deterministic and
free; exercise the live grader with an explicit `charly check feature run <name>`.

### Worked example (end to end)

```bash
# 1. Author plan steps on the layer that provides the behaviour.
$EDITOR candy/web-layer/charly.yml    # add a `check:` step (cdp: eval) +
                                      # an `agent-check:` prose step

# 2. See the agent-graded steps.
charly feature pending candy:web-layer

# 3. Build → run build-context acceptance (deterministic steps).
charly box build web
charly box feature run web

# 4. Deploy, then run deploy-context acceptance with the agent grader.
charly start web
charly check feature run web                # agent-check steps agent-graded against the live pod
charly check feature run web --no-agent     # deterministic-only (CI): agent-check steps report unbound
```

Implementation: `charly/check_feature_run.go` (the verbs), `charly/check_feature_grader.go`
(`AgentGrader` + `RunAIOnce` + `parseVerdict`), the `Runner.Grader` dispatch in
`charly/description_run.go`, and `charly/description_cmd.go` (`charly feature
list/pending/validate`). The plan engine (`RunPlan`) and target
resolution are shared with the harness loop and `charly check box`/`live` (R3).

## Subcommands: live-container verbs

`charly check live` is both the declarative test runner AND the grouping point for the
interactive verbs that drive a running service. Kong's `default:"withargs"`
tag means `charly check live <image>` still dispatches to the runner — only the
explicit subcommand names below take over when matched.

| Subcommand | Skill | Purpose |
|-----------|-------|---------|
| `charly check cdp …` | `/charly-check:cdp` | Chrome DevTools Protocol — open/list/close tabs, click, type, eval, screenshot, axtree |
| `charly check wl …` | `/charly-check:wl` | Wayland desktop input/windows/clipboard + sway IPC |
| `charly check dbus …` | `/charly-check:dbus` | D-Bus calls, introspection, desktop notifications |
| `charly check vnc …` | `/charly-check:vnc` | VNC framebuffer screenshot + click/key/type/passwd |
| `charly check mcp …` | (this skill) | MCP client — ping/list-tools/list-resources/list-prompts/call/read/servers against any `mcp_provide` endpoint. Speaks `github.com/modelcontextprotocol/go-sdk` (Streamable HTTP by default, SSE when `transport: sse`). |
| `charly check record …` | `/charly-check:record` | Recording sessions — start/stop/list/cmd. Terminal (asciinema) or desktop (pixelflux/wf-recorder). Container-only. |
| `charly check spice …` | `/charly-check:spice` | SPICE wire client for VMs — handshake, native-SPICE framebuffer screenshot, input injection. VM-only. |
| `charly check libvirt …` | `/charly-check:libvirt` | libvirt-RPC test commands for VMs — info, domain XML, QMP, qemu-guest-agent, snapshots, events. VM-only. |

These eight verbs live under `charly check` because every one of them is a "probe or
drive a running service" operation — the same surface the declarative test
runner composes when it executes checks.

**Reserved image names:** because subcommand names take priority when
matched, an image literally named `cdp`, `wl`, `dbus`, `vnc`, `mcp`,
`record`, `spice`, or `libvirt` cannot be run via `charly check live <name>` —
use the explicit `charly check live <name>` form or rename the image. No such
images currently exist in `charly.yml`.

**Gotcha — stale container-baked `charly` binary:** `charly check dbus notify` and
`charly check dbus call` delegate to the container's own `charly` binary (see
`charly/notify.go:20`, `charly/dbus.go:195,229`). If the container bakes an `charly`
binary too old to know the `charly check <verb>` subcommand path, the delegation
fails. Fix by rebuilding and redeploying any image that bakes `charly` (grep
`charly.yml` for `- charly$` to find them). Test runner itself is unaffected —
this only bites the host→container delegation paths.

## Authoring: the `plan:` list

Every step is ONE intent keyword (`run:`/`check:`/`agent-run:`/`agent-check:`/
`include:`) carrying prose, plus — for `run:`/`check:` — an inline Op (a single
verb discriminator + shared modifiers + verb-specific attributes). `run:` steps
ARE the install timeline (they replace the old `task:` list); `check:` steps are
the deterministic idempotent probes `charly check`/`charly check live` run.

### Gold-standard pattern (redis candy)

```yaml
# candy/redis/charly.yml
plan:
  # Build-context check: — run inside the built image via `podman run --rm`.
  - check: the redis-server binary is installed
    id: redis-binary
    file: /usr/bin/redis-server
    exists: true
  - check: the redis-cli binary is installed
    id: redis-cli-binary
    file: /usr/bin/redis-cli
    exists: true
  - check: the redis package is installed
    id: redis-package
    package: valkey-compat-redis     # see "Authoring Gotchas" on Fedora 43 renames
    installed: true

  # Deploy-context check: — HOST_PORT:N resolves to the effective port mapping, so
  # the same step works whether the deploy publishes 6379:6379 or 16379:6379.
  - check: redis answers ping over the published port
    id: redis-responds
    context: [deploy]
    command: redis-cli -h 127.0.0.1 -p ${HOST_PORT:6379} ping
    stdout: PONG
    in_container: false    # run redis-cli from the host
  - check: the redis port is reachable from the host
    id: redis-port-open
    context: [deploy]
    addr: 127.0.0.1:${HOST_PORT:6379}
    reachable: true
```

The five `check:` steps cover: binary existence, package identity, a functional
live probe, and raw TCP reachability. Adopt this shape for any primary
service layer.

### Cross-distro package names (`package_map:`)

The `package:` verb chains `rpm -q || dpkg -s || pacman -Q` with a single
literal name, so a test that works on Fedora (`openssh-server`) fails on
Arch (where the package is just `openssh`). `package_map:` is the
authoring hook: the first key that matches any of the image's
`distro:` tags wins; otherwise the `package:` scalar is used as the
fallback. Source: `charly/checkrun_verbs.go:resolvePackageName` + the
`Runner.Distros` field wired from `meta.Distro` at both test entry
points.

```yaml
# candy/sshd/charly.yml — cross-distro authoring
- id: openssh-server-package
  package: openssh-server              # Fedora / Debian default
  package_map:
    arch: openssh                 # Arch ships the metapackage as 'openssh'
    fedora: openssh-server
    fedora:43: openssh-server          # explicit version tag — matches before 'fedora'
  installed: true
```

Tag priority: entries in `distro:` are in priority order (e.g.
`["fedora:43", fedora]`), so `package_map:` can be keyed on either the
version-specific or the family tag, and the more-specific tag wins
naturally. An empty-string map value falls through to the next tag
(see `TestResolvePackageName` in `charly/checkrun_verbs_test.go`).

### Verb catalog (goss-parity feature set)

| Verb | Typical attributes | Notes |
|------|---------------------|-------|
| `file` | `exists`, `mode`, `owner`, `group_of`, `filetype`, `contains`, `sha256` | `group_of` (not `group`) avoids the verb collision |
| `package` | `installed`, `versions` | Tries rpm / dpkg / pacman — exact match on installed name (see gotchas) |
| `service` | `running`, `enabled` | Supervisord first, then systemd |
| `port` | `listening`, `ip`, `reachable` | **`listening` needs `ss`/`netstat` inside the container** — absent from minimal images |
| `process` | `running` | **Needs `pgrep`** — absent from minimal images |
| `command` | `exit_status`, `stdout`, `stderr`, `in_container` | Default runs via `podman exec`; set `in_container: false` to run from host |
| `http` | `status` (int, single value), `body`, `headers`, `method`, `request_body`, `allow_insecure`, `no_follow_redirects`, `ca_file`, `timeout` | Host-side under `charly check live`; curl-in-container under `charly check box` |
| `dns` | `resolvable`, `addrs`, `server` | Host resolver for `charly check live`; `getent hosts` for `charly check box` |
| `user` | `uid`, `gid`, `home`, `shell` | `getent passwd` |
| `group` | `gid`, `groups` | `getent group` |
| `interface` | `mtu`, `addrs` | `ip -o addr show` |
| `kernel-param` | `value` (scalar or matcher) | `sysctl -n` |
| `mount` | `mount_source`, `filesystem`, `opts` | `findmnt` |
| `addr` | `reachable`, `timeout` | Pure Go-native `net.DialTimeout` for `charly check live`; `nc` for `charly check box` |
| `matching` | `contains` | Pure in-process value matching — no target probe |
| `cdp` | Method name (status/list/eval/text/html/url/axtree/screenshot/open/click/type/raw/wait/coords + spa-*) + method-specific modifiers (`tab`, `expression`, `url`, `selector`, `text`, `artifact`, `x`, `y`) + shared `stdout`/`stderr`/`exit_status`/`artifact_min_bytes` | **Deploy-context only.** Wraps `charly check cdp <method>`. See Live-container verb catalog below. |
| `wl` | Method name (screenshot/status/click/type/key/key-combo/mouse/scroll/drag/clipboard/toplevel/windows/focus/close/geometry/xprop/atspi/exec/resolution + overlay-*/sway-*) + method-specific modifiers (`x`, `y`, `text`, `key`, `combo`, `target`, `action`, `artifact`) + shared matchers | **Deploy-context only.** Wraps `charly check wl <method>` (including `sway` and `overlay` nested subgroups). See Live-container verb catalog below. |
| `dbus` | Method name (list/call/introspect/notify) + method-specific modifiers (`dest`, `path`, `method`, `args`, `text`) + shared matchers | **Deploy-context only.** Wraps `charly check dbus <method>`. |
| `vnc` | Method name (status/screenshot/click/mouse/type/key/rfb/passwd) + method-specific modifiers (`x`, `y`, `text`, `key`, `artifact`) + shared matchers | **Deploy-context only.** Wraps `charly check vnc <method>`. |
| `mcp` | Method name (ping/servers/list-tools/list-resources/list-prompts/call/read) + method-specific modifiers (`tool`, `uri`, `input`, `mcp_name`) + shared matchers | **Deploy-context only.** Speaks `github.com/modelcontextprotocol/go-sdk` to any `mcp_provide` endpoint. See "Method allowlist — mcp" below. |

### Shared modifiers

| Field | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| `id` | Optional stable identifier. Enables `charly.yml` to override by `id`. Unique per section per image. |
| `description` | Human-readable label for reports. |
| `skip: true` | Always skip this check (reported but doesn't fail the run). |
| `exclude_distros: [<tag>, ...]` | Skip the check when any of the image's `distro:` tags matches an entry. Use for probes that only apply on some distros (e.g. `file: /usr/bin/fastfetch` is valid on Fedora/Arch/Debian but fastfetch is dropped from Ubuntu 24.04's noble main). Matched against the image's full distro list (`["ubuntu:24.04", "ubuntu", "debian"]`), so either `ubuntu:24.04` or `ubuntu` matches. See `charly/checkspec.go:Op.ExcludeDistros` and `charly/checkrun.go:runOne`. |
| `timeout: "5s"` | Per-check timeout (http, addr). |
| `context: [build\|deploy\|runtime]` | Which contexts the step runs in (a list). Build steps run in `charly check box`; deploy/runtime steps need a live deployment. |

#### `exclude_distros:` worked example

```yaml
- id: fastfetch-binary
  file: /usr/bin/fastfetch
  exists: true
  exclude_distros:
    - ubuntu:24.04
```

On `ghcr.io/overthinkos/ubuntu-coder:latest` this reports `skipped (excluded on distro "ubuntu:24.04")` instead of `failed`. On any other image it runs normally. Prefer this over dropping the test entirely — it keeps the guard in place for Fedora/Arch/Debian and documents why Ubuntu is special.

**Compared to `package_map:`** — `package_map:` changes what the test *probes for* per distro (same semantic, different package name). `exclude_distros:` skips the check entirely — use it when the functionality genuinely doesn't exist on a given distro.

### Matcher forms

Any `MatcherList` attribute (`stdout`, `stderr`, `body`, `headers`,
`contains`, `opts`, `value`) accepts three shapes — picked by yaml.v3
at parse time:

```yaml
stdout: PONG                         # scalar  → [{equals: PONG}]
stdout: [PONG, READY]                # list    → [{equals: PONG}, {equals: READY}]
stdout:
  - equals: PONG                     # operator map
  - contains: ["ready", "ok"]
  - matches: "^[A-Z]+$"
  - not_contains: "error"
```

Supported operators: `equals`, `not_equals`, `contains`, `not_contains`,
`matches`, `not_matches`, plus `lt`/`le`/`gt`/`ge` (numeric, added as
verbs need them).

**`status:` is NOT a MatcherList** — it's a plain `int` on the `http`
verb. One code per test. See Authoring Gotcha #2.

### Live-container verb catalog: `cdp`, `wl`, `dbus`, `vnc`, `mcp`

These five verbs wrap the corresponding `charly check <verb> <method>` CLI
subcommands so every live-container operation (browser automation, Wayland
input/screenshot, D-Bus calls, VNC framebuffer capture, MCP protocol
probes) is authorable as a declarative step. All five are **deploy-context
only** — they need a running container with port mappings; `charly box
validate` rejects them in build context, and `charly check box` skips them at
runtime with a clear message.

**Assertion semantics:** subprocess delegation — the runner executes
`charly check <verb> <method> <image> <args…> [-i <instance>]` on the host,
captures stdout/stderr/exit, and feeds the output through the existing
matcher pipeline. Queries (status/list/eval/text/html/url/axtree/screenshot/…)
produce assertable output. Side-effect actions (click/type/open/close/…) pass
when they exit 0 — follow them with a query check to verify the effect.

**No state chaining (Phase 1):** there's no framework-managed variable to
carry a tab ID or window handle from one check to the next. Authors rely
on conventions (new tabs are usually ID 1) and capture state manually via
follow-up `cdp: list` checks if needed. Phase 2 (deferred) will add
`capture:` + `${CAPTURED:name}` for stateful flows.

#### Method allowlist — `cdp` (15 methods + 6 SPA-nested)

Queries: `status`, `list`, `url`, `text`, `html`, `eval`, `axtree`,
`coords`, `raw`, `wait`, `screenshot`.
Actions: `open`, `close`, `click`, `type`.
SPA-nested (selkies coordinate-scaling / passthrough input):
`spa-status`, `spa-click`, `spa-type`, `spa-key`, `spa-key-combo`,
`spa-mouse`.

```yaml
- id: cdp-up
  cdp: status
  stdout:
    equals: ok

- id: cdp-page-title
  cdp: eval
  tab: "1"
  expression: "document.title"
  stdout: "Dashboard"

- id: cdp-screenshot-valid
  cdp: screenshot
  tab: "1"
  artifact: /tmp/cdp.png
  artifact_min_bytes: 10000       # PNG must be non-empty
```

#### Method allowlist — `wl` (22 top-level + 4 overlay + 12 sway)

Queries: `screenshot`, `status`, `toplevel`, `windows`, `geometry`,
`xprop`, `atspi`, `clipboard`.
Actions: `click`, `double-click`, `mouse`, `scroll`, `drag`, `type`,
`key`, `key-combo`, `focus`, `close`, `fullscreen`, `minimize`, `exec`,
`resolution`.
Overlay-nested: `overlay-list`, `overlay-status`, `overlay-show`,
`overlay-hide`.
Sway-nested: `sway-tree`, `sway-workspaces`, `sway-outputs`, `sway-msg`,
`sway-focus`, `sway-move`, `sway-resize`, `sway-kill`, `sway-floating`,
`sway-layout`, `sway-workspace`, `sway-reload`.

```yaml
- id: wl-desktop-captured
  wl: screenshot
  artifact: /tmp/wl.png
  artifact_min_bytes: 10000

- id: wl-has-windows
  wl: toplevel
  stdout:
    matches: "."        # at least one line of output

- id: wl-sway-has-workspace-1
  wl: sway-workspaces
  stdout:
    contains: '"name":"1"'
```

#### Method allowlist — `dbus` (4 methods)

Queries: `list`, `call`, `introspect`.
Actions: `notify`.

```yaml
- id: dbus-notifications-registered
  dbus: list
  stdout:
    contains: "org.freedesktop.Notifications"

- id: dbus-get-capabilities
  dbus: call
  dest: org.freedesktop.Notifications
  path: /org/freedesktop/Notifications
  method: org.freedesktop.Notifications.GetCapabilities
  args: []
  stdout:
    contains: body
```

#### Method allowlist — `vnc` (8 methods)

Queries: `status`, `screenshot`, `rfb`.
Actions: `click`, `mouse`, `type`, `key`, `passwd`.

```yaml
- id: vnc-up
  vnc: status
  stdout:
    equals: ok

- id: vnc-framebuffer-captured
  vnc: screenshot
  artifact: /tmp/vnc.png
  artifact_min_bytes: 5000
```

#### Method allowlist — `mcp` (7 methods)

Queries: `ping`, `servers`, `list-tools`, `list-resources`, `list-prompts`,
`read`.
Actions: `call`.

The `mcp` verb speaks the Model Context Protocol to any server advertised
via `mcp_provide`. URL resolution is automatic — the runner reads the
image's `ai.opencharly.mcp_provide` OCI label, substitutes
`{{.ContainerName}}`, runs the entries through `podAwareMCPProvides`, and
then rewrites the host portion to `127.0.0.1:<published-host-port>` using
the same port-mapping data that powers `${HOST_PORT:N}`. No URL argument
is needed in YAML.

Transport dispatch: `transport: http` (or empty) → Streamable HTTP;
`transport: sse` → SSE. Anything else is rejected at dial time.

Disambiguation: if an image declares multiple `mcp_provide` entries,
add `mcp_name: <server>` on the check; otherwise the single entry
auto-picks.

```yaml
- id: mcp-ping
  context: [deploy]
  mcp: ping
  timeout: 10s                # optional; default 30s

- id: mcp-list-tools
  context: [deploy]
  mcp: list-tools
  stdout:
    - contains: insert_cell   # plaintext "name\tdescription" per line
    - contains: execute_cell

- id: mcp-call-tool
  context: [deploy]
  mcp: call
  tool: list_notebooks        # required
  input: "{}"                 # optional JSON arg blob
  exit_status: 0              # assert no IsError

- id: mcp-read-resource
  context: [deploy]
  mcp: read
  uri: file:///tmp/example.txt
  stdout:
    - matches: "."            # non-empty body
```

Ad-hoc CLI equivalents (each leaf also supports `--json` for programmatic
use and `--name <server>` for multi-server images):

```bash
charly check mcp ping       <image> [-i <instance>] [--name <server>]
charly check mcp servers    <image> [-i <instance>]
charly check mcp list-tools <image> [-i <instance>] [--name <server>]
charly check mcp call       <image> <tool> '<json-args>' [-i <instance>]
charly check mcp read       <image> <uri>            [-i <instance>]
```

Output format: tab-separated plaintext (one record per line) so matchers
can `contains:` without JSON decoding. `list-tools` emits
`<name>\t<description>`; `list-resources` emits `<uri>\t<name>\t<mime>`;
`call` emits the concatenated `TextContent` payloads; `ping` emits `ok`.

#### Artifact-validation modifiers

For artifact-producing methods (`cdp: screenshot`, `wl: screenshot`,
`vnc: screenshot`, `libvirt: screenshot`, `spice: screenshot`,
`record: stop`), set `artifact: <path>` to tell `charly` where to write the
output AND any combination of the modifiers below to assert the
artifact's correctness post-run.

- **`artifact_min_bytes: <N>`** — assert the file is at least N bytes
  after the run. Guards against zero-byte files. Cheap (`os.Stat`
  only).
- **`artifact_min_dimensions: WxH`** — assert decoded image width and
  height are each at least the given values. Reads only the PNG/JPEG
  header via `image.DecodeConfig`, so essentially free. Catches "the
  screenshot ran but the compositor produced 320×240 instead of the
  expected 1920×1080".
- **`artifact_not_uniform: true`** — assert the image is not uniformly
  one color. Decodes the full image and samples 100 pixels at
  deterministic stride positions; fails if every sampled pixel has
  the same RGBA. Catches the failure mode `artifact_min_bytes` is
  blind to: a 100KB all-black PNG passes the byte check but fails
  this one. Use on every screenshot probe where "the image has real
  content" matters.
- **`artifact_min_cast_events: <N>`** — for asciinema `.cast`
  artifacts (e.g. `record: stop` in terminal mode): validates the
  first line is the asciinema v2 header and counts at least N event
  lines after it. Catches "the recording started and stopped but
  captured nothing because nothing was typed".

```yaml
# Combined screenshot validity assertion — bytes + dimensions + content.
- id: cdp-screenshot-real
  cdp: screenshot
  tab: "1"
  artifact: /tmp/cdp.png
  artifact_min_bytes: 5000
  artifact_min_dimensions: 800x600
  artifact_not_uniform: true

# Recording validity — bytes + event count.
- id: record-cast-has-events
  record: stop
  artifact: /tmp/session.cast
  artifact_min_bytes: 200
  artifact_min_cast_events: 5
```

The four modifiers are independent — set just the one you need or
combine all four for the strongest "the artifact is real" assertion.
Failure messages identify the specific artifact and the specific
threshold that wasn't met.

#### Gotcha — stale container-baked `charly` binary

The `dbus:` verb invokes the container's `charly` binary via delegation. If
the container bakes an `charly` binary too old to know the `charly check <verb>`
subcommand path, the delegation fails. Rebuild and redeploy any image that
bakes `charly` (grep `charly.yml` for `- charly$`). The test runner itself is
unaffected; this only bites the host→container delegation paths in the
`dbus` verb.

## Authoring Gotchas (learned the hard way)

These are the non-obvious issues that surface only when you run the tests
against real containers. Skim before writing new checks.

### 1. Host-side deploy tests: `127.0.0.1:${HOST_PORT:N}`, NOT `${CONTAINER_IP}:${HOST_PORT:N}`

In rootless podman, the container's pod-network IP (e.g. `10.89.0.x`) is
not routable from the host. `${HOST_PORT:N}` resolves to a port on the
host's loopback that forwards into the container. Combining them is
nonsense:

```yaml
# ❌ WRONG — 10.89.0.x:HOST_PORT is unreachable from either side.
addr: ${CONTAINER_IP}:${HOST_PORT:8080}

# ✓ RIGHT — host-side access via the forwarded port.
addr: 127.0.0.1:${HOST_PORT:8080}

# ✓ ALSO RIGHT — in-container, using the container port directly.
command: curl -fsS http://127.0.0.1:8080/health
in_container: true
```

Use `${CONTAINER_IP}` only from inside another container in the same pod.

### 2. `http` status is a single int — no lists

```yaml
# ❌ WRONG — yaml unmarshals a list to int fails with "cannot unmarshal !!seq"
status: [200, 301, 302]

# ✓ RIGHT — pick the most-likely code. Or author multiple tests.
status: 200
```

For endpoints that return 400/401 when probed without auth (MCP servers,
API endpoints), `status: 400` is a legitimate "endpoint exists and refuses
empty input" check.

### 3. `pgrep`, `ss`, `nc` are NOT in minimal images

The `process:`, `port: listening`, and `nc`-based command tests silently
fail on images that skip `procps-ng` / `iproute` / `ncat`. Portable
alternatives:

| Intent | Portable alternative |
|--------|----------------------|
| "supervisord is running" | `command: supervisorctl pid; exit_status: 0` (in_container) |
| "some program under supervisord" | `service: <name>; running: true` |
| "port N listening in-container" | `command: curl -fsS http://127.0.0.1:N/<route>; in_container: true` |
| "port reachable from host" | `addr: 127.0.0.1:${HOST_PORT:N}; reachable: true` (Go-native dial) |

### 4. `supervisorctl status` exits 3 when ANY program is non-RUNNING

Layers like `hermes` declare `autostart=false` programs (e.g.
`hermes-whatsapp`), which leaves them STOPPED. `supervisorctl status`
returns exit 3 — fails `exit_status: 0` checks.

```yaml
# ❌ BRITTLE — fails if any program is autostart=false.
command: supervisorctl status
exit_status: 0

# ✓ ROBUST — `pid` asks for supervisord's own PID, 0 iff the socket
# responds.
command: supervisorctl pid
exit_status: 0
in_container: true
```

### 5. Know which stream a `--version`-style command writes to

`charly version` writes to **stdout** (via `fmt.Println`) — the canonical
`candy/charly/charly.yml` test asserts a `stdout:` matcher.

```yaml
- id: charly-version
  command: /usr/local/bin/charly version
  exit_status: 0
  stdout:
    - matches: "[0-9]{4}\\.[0-9]+"
```

**But other tools genuinely write to stderr** — `ssh -V`, `openssl version`,
some `*-config --version` scripts. Always probe first
(`charly cmd <image> '<cmd> 2>&1 >/dev/null'` — if the output shows up here
it was stderr; if silent, it's stdout). See also the `ssh-version`
check in `candy/ssh-client/charly.yml` which IS a real stderr case.

### 6. Drop `$` anchor in `matches:` regexes on command output

Command stdout typically ends with `\n`. Go's `regexp` treats `$` as
end-of-input (not end-of-line by default), so `\.ipynb$` won't match
`path.ipynb\n`. Drop the anchor:

```yaml
# ❌ WRONG — fails because trailing newline
stdout:
  - matches: "\\.ipynb$"

# ✓ RIGHT — substring match is usually what you want
stdout:
  - matches: "\\.ipynb"
```

### 7. `${VAR:-default}` is NOT supported by charly's resolver

charly's variable resolver accepts `${IDENT}` only — no bash-style defaults,
no parameter expansion. An unresolved variable is reported as a
`unresolved variables: <name>` SKIP.

```yaml
# ❌ Parsed as a single var name; reported as unresolved if not set
command: psql -U ${POSTGRES_USER:-postgres}

# ✓ Plain env-var reference; resolves from the container's environment
# in the deploy context. For a true default, set it in the layer's `env:`.
command: psql -U ${POSTGRES_USER}
```

### 8. Fedora 43 package renames — query the installed name, not the dnf request

The `package:` verb does exact string equality against the rpm
database, not the dnf install request. When dnf resolves a virtual
provides, the test must name the actual installed package.

| dnf request | Installed name on Fedora 43 |
|-------------|-----------------------------|
| `redis` | `valkey-compat-redis` |
| `liberation-fonts` | `liberation-sans-fonts` (+ `-serif-fonts`, `-mono-fonts`) |

Always verify with `charly shell <image> -c 'rpm -qf /path/to/binary'`.

### 9. Volume paths don't exist at build context

`/workspace`, `${VOLUME_CONTAINER_PATH:name}`, and similar paths
are provisioned by `charly config` at deploy time. A build-context step on
them fails in `charly check box` because the mount isn't attached.

```yaml
# ❌ Fails under `charly check box` — workspace isn't mounted
- id: workspace-dir
  file: /workspace
  filetype: directory

# ✓ context: [deploy] so it runs only against live containers
- id: workspace-dir
  context: [deploy]
  file: /workspace
  filetype: directory
```

### 10. Disposable tests run as the image's default USER — not root

`charly check box` runs `podman run --rm <image>` with the image's USER
directive (typically uid 1000 for containers). Root-only files
(e.g. `/etc/sudoers.d/*` is root:root 0750) report as "missing" because
the user can't traverse the parent directory.

```yaml
# ❌ Reports "exists=false" even though the file IS there (0750 dir)
- id: sudoers-charly-user
  file: /etc/sudoers.d/charly-user
  exists: true

# ✓ Verify the semantic (can I sudo?) instead of the file bit
- id: sudoers-charly-user
  command: sudo -n -l
  exit_status: 0
  stdout:
    - contains: "NOPASSWD"
```

### 11. **Bootc images keep USER=root** — tests must cover both modes

Gotcha 10 flips for bootc. `charly/generate.go` deliberately omits the final `USER <uid>` directive on bootc images because systemd (PID 1 in a bootc VM) manages user sessions via login, so the container's own USER directive is irrelevant. Result: the same `charly check box` that runs as uid 1000 in a container runs as **uid 0** in a bootc image.

That breaks any test that assumes the user-context default. A `sudo -n -l` check that expects `NOPASSWD` in the output works for non-bootc (USER=1000 → sudo lists the user's NOPASSWD rule) but fails for bootc (USER=0 → sudo prints root's Defaults block, which doesn't contain the literal string `NOPASSWD`). Same failure mode for any `test -f ~/.config/foo` that depends on `$HOME=/home/user`.

The fix: drop into `user` explicitly when running as root, stay as-is otherwise. Use **`runuser -u user -- <cmd>`** as the bridge — it's portable across util-linux versions and preserves stdout:

```yaml
# Dual-mode: container (USER=1000) AND bootc (USER=root) both pass
- id: sudoers-charly-user
  command: |
    if [ "$(id -u)" = "0" ]; then
      runuser -u user -- sudo -n -l
    else
      sudo -n -l
    fi
  exit_status: 0
  stdout:
    - contains: "NOPASSWD"
```

**Don't use `runuser -l user -s /bin/bash -c '…'`.** On Arch's util-linux
(2.42+), `runuser -l … -c` swallows the wrapped command's stdout when
the shell is a login shell — reproduced: `runuser -l user -s /bin/bash
-c 'sudo -n -l'` prints nothing and exits 0; `runuser -u user -- sudo
-n -l` prints the full NOPASSWD listing. This bit the earlier shipping
form of the test; the sshd candy now uses `-u … --`.

Worked example: `/charly-coder:sshd` ships exactly the `-u user --` pattern. Alternative: give the step `context: [deploy]` so it runs against a live container where you control the user-switch externally.

### 12. **`charly check box <short-name>` is ambiguous with multiple CalVer tags** — use the full registry ref

`charly check box` resolves its positional argument against **local podman storage**, not `charly.yml`. When the host has accumulated many CalVer tags for the same image (a normal consequence of iterative `charly box build` runs), the short form errors out:

```
charly: error: ambiguous short name "openclaw-desktop" in local storage;
           candidates: ghcr.io/overthinkos/openclaw-desktop:latest,
           ghcr.io/overthinkos/openclaw-desktop:2026.109.1418,
           ... Re-run with a full ref.
```

Use the fully-qualified registry ref:

```bash
charly check box ghcr.io/overthinkos/openclaw-desktop:latest
```

This is different from `charly box inspect`, `charly box build`, and `charly check live` (the live-service runner), which key off `charly.yml` and accept short names unambiguously. Only the disposable-container runner has this restriction because it does not consult `charly.yml` at all.

## Three levels, three sections

| Section | Authored in | When it runs |
|---------|-------------|--------------|
| `candy` | `plan:` in `candy/<name>/charly.yml` (build context) | `charly check box` + `charly check live` |
| `box` | `plan:` in `charly.yml` per box (build context) | `charly check box` + `charly check live` |
| `deploy` | a `plan:` step with `context: [deploy]`, or a local `charly.yml` `plan:` overlay | `charly check live <name>` only (deploy-context steps need a running deployment with port mappings, volumes, and resolved runtime variables) |

The `ai.opencharly.description` label carries the collected `plan:` steps from all three
sections with `origin:` annotations (`candy:<name>`, `box:<name>`, `deploy-default`,
`deploy-local`). `CollectDescriptions` walks the base-image chain with a
visited-image guard: cycles are reported by `validateBoxDAG` at validate
time, but the collector itself terminates cleanly even if called on a
pathological config.

## Verb routing (which executor runs each check)

Every verb dispatches through one of two executors depending on the run
mode — this is what makes the same `plan:` work both against a
disposable container (`charly check box`) and a running service (`charly check live`):

| Verb + attributes | Under `charly check live` (running service) | Under `charly check box` (disposable) |
|-------------------|-----------------------------------|------------------------------------|
| file, package, service, process, user, group, interface, kernel-param, mount | `ContainerExecutor` (`podman exec`) | `ImageExecutor` (`podman run --rm`) |
| port with `listening` | `ContainerExecutor` (`ss`/`netstat` inside) | `ImageExecutor` |
| port with `reachable` | Host-side `net.DialTimeout` | Skipped (no host port binding on a disposable run) |
| command (`in_container: true`, default) | `ContainerExecutor` | `ImageExecutor` |
| command (`in_container: false`) | Host-side `exec.Command` | Skipped |
| http, dns, addr | Host-side (from the `charly` process) | In-container `curl` / `getent hosts` / `nc` |
| matching | In-process matcher check | Same |

The routing table lives in `charly/checkrun.go` (`runOne` switch) and
`charly/checkrun_verbs.go`. When a check is unroutable (e.g. `port:
reachable` under `charly check box`), the runner reports it as **skipped**
with a reason rather than failing the run.

### in-container `command:` stdin is guarded

An in-container `command:` script (`in_container: true`, the default) is
delivered to the pod shell over a stdin heredoc (`NestedExecutor.wrapWithJump`,
"stdin-attached exec"). The runner wraps every such script in
`{ <script>; } </dev/null` (`wrapContainerCommand`, `charly/checkrun.go`) so a
subcommand that reads stdin — `adb shell`, `ssh`, `read`, `cat` — cannot consume
the rest of the heredoc (the not-yet-run script lines, which would otherwise
truncate the check to its first command). Authors write plain multi-line
scripts; **no per-call-site `</dev/null` is needed**. Host-side `command:`
(`in_container: false`) runs via `sh -c` argv and is unaffected. For Android UI
readiness, prefer the typed `adb: wait-ui-settled` / `current-focus` / `keyevent`
verbs (`/charly-check:adb`) over shell entirely.

## Runtime variables

`charly check live` resolves these via `podman inspect` on the running container
before any check executes. `${NAME:arg}` is parameterized form.

| Variable | Source | Context |
|----------|--------|-------|
| `${USER}`, `${HOME}`, `${UID}`, `${GID}` | Image metadata (OCI labels) | build + deploy |
| `${IMAGE}` | Image metadata | build + deploy |
| `${DNS}`, `${ACME_EMAIL}` | Image metadata + charly.yml overlay | build + deploy |
| `${INSTANCE}` | `--instance` flag / charly.yml key | deploy |
| `${CONTAINER_NAME}`, `${CONTAINER_IP}` | `podman inspect` | deploy |
| `${HOST_PORT:N}` | Port mapping for container port N | deploy |
| `${VOLUME_PATH:name}` | Host path backing the named volume (bind source, encrypted mount, or `_data` dir) | deploy |
| `${VOLUME_CONTAINER_PATH:name}` | In-container mount path for a volume | deploy |
| `${ENV_NAME}` | Effective env var value on the running container | deploy |
| `${PEER_HOST:name}` | A SEPARATE deployment's container DNS name on the shared `charly` net (`charly-<name>`); cross-deployment addressing (see below) | deploy |
| `${PEER_ENDPOINT:name:port}` | A host-reachable `127.0.0.1:NNNN` for a separate deployment's `port` (published port / VM ssh-forward); host-vantage cross-deployment addressing | deploy |

Build-context steps may **not** reference deploy-context variables — the
validator flags this at `charly box validate` time.

**No bash-style defaults**: `${VAR:-fallback}` is unsupported (see
Authoring Gotcha #7). Plain `${VAR}` only.

## Cross-deployment probing — `on:` driver, `peer:` siblings, `${PEER_*}`

A check normally probes **the deployment under test**. Cross-deployment probing
lets ONE deployment act as a test DRIVER against a SEPARATE deployment as the
SUBJECT — the canonical case being a **Chrome DRIVER pod that CDP-probes a
separate web-server SUBJECT pod**, so a real browser tests the subject without
baking Chrome into the subject image. "A different kind of deployment tests
another kind" — pod→pod, local→pod, and local→VM, all through one mechanism.

Three pieces compose it:

- **`on: <driver>`** (the step modifier) — DISPATCH this probe against a named
  DRIVER deployment instead of the subject. For a `cdp:`/`vnc:`/`mcp:` check it
  connects to the driver's CDP/VNC/MCP endpoint (`charly check cdp <method> <driver>`);
  for a `command:` check it runs in the driver's venue. Works in `charly check live`,
  `kind: check` beds, and `iterate:` beds (the driver's own `${HOST_PORT}`/`${CONTAINER_IP}`
  resolve too).
- **`peer:` siblings** — bring the driver up ALONGSIDE the subject on the shared
  `charly` network (see `/charly-core:deploy` "Sibling peers"). A `kind: check` bed (or a
  `kind: deploy`) declares the driver under `peer:`; it is brought up by the same
  deploy verbs and is NEVER check-live'd (an instrument, not a subject).
- **`${PEER_*}` address variables** — let the driven probe TARGET the subject:
  - **`${PEER_HOST:<name>}`** → the deployment's container DNS name on the shared
    `charly` net (`charly-<name>`; also verifies it is running). The pod→pod address:
    `http://${PEER_HOST:<subject>}:8080`. Reference the subject by its OWN deploy
    name (for a bed, that's the bed name — the container is `charly-<bedname>`).
  - **`${PEER_ENDPOINT:<name>:<port>}`** → a host-reachable `127.0.0.1:NNNN` for
    that deployment's `<port>` (container published port, or an ssh `-L` forward
    for a VM/host subject). The host-vantage address a `local`/host driver uses to
    reach a pod/VM subject. (Both are runtime-only — a build-context step can't use
    them.)

  An unresolvable `${PEER_*}` — the peer/subject is unreachable (not running, bad
  port, VM ssh-forward refused) — **FAILS** the referencing check, never SKIPs it.
  A skip on an unreachable dependency is a fake pass: it would let a bed go green
  even though the cross-deployment probe never reached its target. (Legitimate
  skips — `skip: true`, `exclude_distros`, a deploy-only var under build context —
  are unaffected; only an unresolved mandatory `${PEER_*}` is treated as a failure.)

### Worked example — a Chrome pod CDP-probes a web-server pod (pod→pod)

```yaml
# charly.yml check: block — kind:check bed: web SUBJECT (root) + chrome DRIVER (peer)
check-cross-pod-cdp:
    target: pod

`bringUpPeers` config+starts the chrome peer alongside the web root; the
`on: chrome` checks dispatch `charly check cdp <method> chrome` (connecting to chrome's
published 9222) while `${PEER_HOST:check-cross-pod-cdp}` resolves to the web
subject's `charly-check-cross-pod-cdp` container, reached over the shared net.

**Driver-box requirement (CDP):** a headless Chrome CDP driver MUST launch with
`--remote-allow-origins='*'` (Chrome 146+ rejects the CDP WebSocket upgrade
otherwise — `cdp open` via HTTP works, but `cdp text`/`check`/`screenshot` fail).
The `chrome-headless` box sets it; see `/charly-check:cdp` "Requirements".

### Cross-kind: a host driver reaching a pod OR a VM subject (`${PEER_ENDPOINT}`)

`${PEER_ENDPOINT}` is **kind-agnostic** — it routes through the ONE host-vantage
port resolver (`resolveCheckEndpoint`): a pod subject resolves to its auto-
published port (`podman port`); a VM subject resolves to an `ssh -L
127.0.0.1:<rand>:127.0.0.1:<guestport>` forward over the managed `charly-<vm>` alias
(the SAME forward `check-k3s-vm` uses to reach the cluster API host-side). So the
identical check — `command: curl …${PEER_ENDPOINT:<subject>:<port>}` dispatched
`on:` a `kind: local` host driver — proves a pod subject (`check-cross-local-http`)
and a VM subject (`check-cross-vm-http`) with ZERO kind-specific check code; only
the subject kind differs.

**The VM subject is driven from a host-side (`target: local`) peer, NOT a pod
driver.** `${PEER_ENDPOINT}` is a host-vantage `127.0.0.1:NNNN` address; a pod
driver can't reach it (that loopback is the pod's own netns), and a rootless
`qemu:///session` VM shares no L2 bridge with rootless pods. The generic, no-hack
VM cell therefore uses a local driver peer — the host where both the published
port and the ssh-forward live. (`${PEER_HOST}` — pod-net container DNS — is the
pod→pod address and does NOT reach a VM.)

## Deploy.yml overlay rules

A local `charly.yml` can contribute its own `plan:` steps per image.
Merge rules applied by `charly check live`:

1. Local entries with an `id:` matching a baked entry replace that entry.
2. Entries without a matching `id:` are appended.
3. To disable a baked check, reference it with `id:` and `skip: true`.

```yaml
# ~/.config/charly/charly.yml
box:
  redis-ml:
    plan:
      - check: redis answers ping               # overrides image's baked step (by id)
        id: redis-responds
        command: redis-cli -h 127.0.0.1 -p 16379 ping
        stdout: PONG
        in_container: false
      - check: the external tunnel is healthy   # appended (no baked match)
        id: external-tunnel
        http: https://redis.tailnet.ts.net/health
        status: 200
      - check: a legacy baked step              # disable a legacy baked step
        id: old-probe
        skip: true
```

## Typical workflow

```bash
# 1. Author tests in candy/<name>/charly.yml.
# 2. Validate schema + references.
charly box validate

# 3. Build the image (the plan is auto-embedded as `LabelDescriptionSet`).
#    LABELs are emitted LAST in the final stage — a test edit rebuilds
#    in ~2 sec (cache hits every upstream RUN/COPY).
charly box build redis-ml

# 4. Run against a disposable container (build-context steps only).
charly check box redis-ml

# 5. Start the service and test end-to-end.
charly start redis-ml
charly check live redis-ml

# 6. Override a baked deploy check via local charly.yml, re-test.
$EDITOR ~/.config/charly/charly.yml    # add tests: entry with matching id
charly check live redis-ml
```

## Coverage snapshot (7 currently-tested images)

Reference numbers from the last end-to-end session:

| Image | Tests | Pass | Fail | Skipped |
|-------|-------|------|------|---------|
| `filebrowser` | 24 | 24 | 0 | 0 |
| `jupyter` | 32 | 32 | 0 | 0 (includes 3 declarative `mcp:` checks) |
| `openwebui` | 24 | 24 | 0 | 0 |
| `hermes` | 50 | 50 | 0 | 0 |
| `immich-ml` | 63 | 61 | 0 | 2 (redis port internal) |
| `selkies-desktop` | 91 | 91 | 0 | 0 |
| `sway-browser-vnc` | 92 | 92 | 0 | 0 (includes 7 declarative cdp/wl/dbus/vnc/mcp checks; 2 mcp tests come from the chrome-devtools-mcp layer) |

**Total: 376 checks across 7 images (0 failing).**

The "skipped" entries are intentional — they reference ports that
aren't mapped in the containing image's `port:` block. Skipping them
is correct behavior; they'd pass in an image that does expose those
ports.

## Realistic run-time expectations

`charly check run default` is a multi-phase AI-iteration loop. Representative
per-phase durations (measured solving all 92/92 across 9 iterations on a
`disposable: true` check-sandbox):

| Phase | Plan segment | Typical iter1 duration | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | single-pod-system-state | ~10 min | trivial pod deploy |
| 2 | network-and-http | ~few min (cumulative scoring keeps phase 1 in scope) | nginx + curl in fedora:43 |
| 3 | cross-pod-nonce-traffic | ~few min | redis + redis-client; EVAL_NONCE_KEY/VALUE substituted per iter |
| 4 | mcp-protocol-probe | ~14 min | jupyter image build (~6 min) + 32 check steps |
| 5 | kubernetes-cluster | ~20-30 min | k3s/kwok cluster bring-up |
| 6 | desktop-display-and-input | ~50 min iter1, ~10 min iter2 | sway-browser-vnc image build (~14 min) + 13 cdp/wl/vnc checks; commonly takes 2 iters due to Chrome SIGBUS instability |
| 7 | vm-control-libvirt-spice | ~40-50 min | libvirt domain (cloud-init, qemu-guest-agent) + 9 checks |
| 8 | nested-deployment-chain | ~40 min | socket-passthrough nested pods + 9 cross-hop checks |

**Total wall-clock for a fresh `charly check run default`**: typically
**5-7 hours** on dev-class hardware. Set expectations accordingly — this
is NOT a quick smoke. For a fast canary that exercises the loader +
scoring paths end-to-end without real AI work, run
`charly check run scaffolding-selftest` (~5 min, a single-segment plan
that `include:`s `composition-import-selftest`).

The plateau bound is `iterate.plateau_iteration` (default 3). In
**progressive mode**, plateau ENDS the whole run — it does not advance
to the next phase, so an AI that stalls on one phase doesn't collect
easy wins on later phases it never engaged with.

## Issue 52328 (claude-code Bash + pgrep self-match deadlock) defense

The Claude Code runtime has a known issue documented in this project's
own `.check/ISSUE-claude-code-bash-pgrep-self-match-deadlock.md`: when
the AI uses `Bash{run_in_background: true}` with a `until ! pgrep -f
"<pattern>"` poll-loop, the literal pattern string is preserved in the
spawned bash's argv (because the wrapper uses `bash -c '… check
"<command>" …'`). `pgrep -f` then **matches itself**, the loop spins
forever, the parent `claude -p` process can't exit because it waits
for all background bash subprocesses, and the harness orchestrator
deadlocks waiting on claude.

The harness defends against this pattern between iterations: at every
iter end (in `check_loop.go`'s `commitIterationBestEffort`), the
orchestrator runs
`podman exec charly-check-sandbox pkill -f "while true.*sleep [0-9]+"` to
clean up orphaned keepalive bashes left dangling by the AI's
`TaskOutput`-timeout pattern, and logs the kill count.

Workaround for the AI inside the loop: prefer `kill -0 <PID>`-style
checks (track the original PID via `cmd & echo $!`) over `pgrep -f`
when the pattern would also match the wrapping bash. The harness
defense is a safety net, not a license to use the broken pattern
deliberately.

behavior at any level. Triggers: `charly check` (any subcommand), `charly check
run`, `charly check box`, `charly check live`, the `plan:` / `description:`
YAML fields, the project-root `check:` block, the `ai.opencharly.description` OCI label, `kind: agent` /
`kind: check` (+ the bed's `iterate:` block) in the `check:` block,
`charly check run <bed>` / `--all-beds` (kind:check R10 beds), or any check
verb by name (file/port/http/command/package/service/cdp/wl/dbus/vnc/mcp/...).
