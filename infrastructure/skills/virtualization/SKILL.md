# virtualization — QEMU/KVM/libvirt for both supervisord and systemd init systems

## Canonical worked example: mixed-`service:` polymorphism

This candy is the canonical demonstration that ONE candy can serve BOTH container/pod targets (supervisord init) AND host/bootc/VM targets (systemd init) without spawning a `<name>-host` sibling. The mechanism is the **mixed `service:` schema pattern** COMBINED with a **per-entry `distro:` filter**:

- **Init-system polymorphism** — each daemon appears TWICE with the same `name:`: once with `use_packaged: <unit>.socket` (rendered only on systemd-init targets) and once with custom `exec:` (rendered only on supervisord-init targets). The init system at deploy time picks the matching form; the other is silently skipped.
- **Distro polymorphism (`distro:` filter)** — the libvirt daemon set is DISTRO-DIVERGENT. Fedora and Arch ship the SPLIT modular daemons (`virtqemud` + `virtnetworkd`, with `virtqemud.socket` / `virtnetworkd.socket` units). Debian and Ubuntu build libvirt WITHOUT the split — there is **no** `virtqemud`/`virtnetworkd` binary and **no** `*.socket` unit, only the MONOLITHIC `libvirtd` (`libvirtd.socket`), which serves both the qemu and network drivers (RDD-proven on debian:13, libvirt 11.3.0). Each entry carries a `distro:` list restricting it to the distros whose libvirt build actually ships that daemon. An entry with an empty/absent `distro:` renders on every distro (the default); a non-empty list renders only on the matching distros.

```yaml
service:
  # ----- virtqemud + virtnetworkd (Fedora/Arch modular) -----
  - name: virtqemud
    use_packaged: virtqemud.socket
    distro: [fedora, arch]            # systemd render (Fedora/Arch only)
    enable: true
    scope: system
  - name: virtqemud
    exec: "/usr/sbin/virtqemud --timeout 0"
    distro: [fedora, arch]            # supervisord render (Fedora/Arch only)
    restart: always
    priority: 5
    start_sec: 2
    enable: true
    scope: system
  - name: virtnetworkd
    use_packaged: virtnetworkd.socket
    distro: [fedora, arch]
    enable: true
    scope: system
  - name: virtnetworkd
    exec: "/usr/sbin/virtnetworkd --timeout 0"
    distro: [fedora, arch]
    restart: always
    priority: 6
    start_sec: 2
    enable: true
    scope: system
  # ----- libvirtd (Debian/Ubuntu monolithic) -----
  - name: libvirtd
    use_packaged: libvirtd.socket
    distro: [debian, ubuntu]          # systemd render (Debian/Ubuntu only)
    enable: true
    scope: system
  - name: libvirtd
    exec: "/usr/sbin/libvirtd --timeout 0"
    distro: [debian, ubuntu]          # supervisord render (Debian/Ubuntu only)
    restart: always
    priority: 5
    start_sec: 2
    enable: true
    scope: system
```

The `distro:` filter is applied at render time against the target's distro tag chain — in the DEPLOY path (`compileServiceSteps`, VM/host/pod) and in the BUILD path (`generateInitFragments` for supervisord fragments + the bootc `system_enable` units). A Debian systemd VM therefore enables ONLY `libvirtd.socket`; a Fedora container's supervisord runs ONLY `virtqemud` + `virtnetworkd`.

Why this matters: a `<name>-host` (or per-distro) sibling candy would duplicate package lists, check probes, and tasks, and drift between the siblings would be inevitable. The mixed-entry + `distro:`-filter pattern eliminates the sibling — ONE candy covers every (init-system × distro) cell; the schema does the polymorphism. See CLAUDE.md "Init-system polymorphism via mixed `service:` entries" for the rule and `/charly-image:layer` "Service Declaration" → "Anti-pattern: `<name>-host` / `<name>-pod` sibling candies" for what NOT to do.

## Overview

Installs the QEMU/KVM/libvirt stack AND ships supervisord programs for the
distro's libvirt daemon(s) — `virtqemud` + `virtnetworkd` on Fedora/Arch, the
monolithic `libvirtd` on Debian/Ubuntu — running as the candy consumer's uid.
In session mode (`qemu:///session`), these daemons and their clients all
work at uid 1000 with only `/dev/kvm` device passthrough — no
`CAP_SYS_ADMIN`, no root escalation. Makes nested rootless VM creation
work end-to-end from a rootless outer container.

## Candy Properties

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| `require:` | `supervisord` |
| Services registered (Fedora/Arch) | `virtqemud` (priority 5), `virtnetworkd` (priority 6) |
| Services registered (Debian/Ubuntu) | `libvirtd` (priority 5) — monolithic; serves both drivers |
| Devices | `/dev/kvm` is required by consumers; declared at the box level or via `/charly-distros:container-nesting` |

## Packages (RPM)

Baseline QEMU + libvirt client + guest tools:

- `bindfs`, `genisoimage`, `guestfs-tools`, `libguestfs-tools`
- `libvirt-nss`, `passt`, `qemu-guest-agent`
- `qemu-img`, `qemu-kvm`
- `qemu-system-aarch64`, `qemu-system-arm`, `qemu-system-x86-core`
- `tigervnc`, `virt-manager`, `virt-viewer`

Libvirt split-daemon set (explicitly listed so images can run the
session daemon even without `virt-manager`):

- `libvirt-client` — `virsh` binary
- `libvirt-daemon` — `/usr/sbin/virtqemud`, `/usr/sbin/virtnetworkd`
- `libvirt-daemon-config-network`
- `libvirt-daemon-driver-qemu`

## Packages (Pacman)

`qemu-full`, `qemu-img`, `virtiofsd`, `libvirt`.

## Supervisord services

The candy's `service:` block registers the distro's daemon(s). On a **Fedora/Arch**
supervisord container (the `distro: [fedora, arch]` exec entries):

```ini
[program:virtqemud]
command=/usr/sbin/virtqemud --timeout 0
autostart=true
autorestart=true
priority=5
startsecs=2
stdout_logfile=/dev/fd/1
stdout_logfile_maxbytes=0
redirect_stderr=true

[program:virtnetworkd]
command=/usr/sbin/virtnetworkd --timeout 0
autostart=true
autorestart=true
priority=6
startsecs=2
stdout_logfile=/dev/fd/1
stdout_logfile_maxbytes=0
redirect_stderr=true
```

On a **Debian/Ubuntu** supervisord container (the `distro: [debian, ubuntu]` exec
entry) the candy instead registers ONE monolithic program — verified in the
emitted `NN-virtualization.conf` fragment of a `debian-coder` build:

```ini
[program:libvirtd]
command=/usr/sbin/libvirtd --timeout 0
autostart=true
autorestart=true
priority=5
startsecs=2
stdout_logfile=/dev/fd/1
stdout_logfile_maxbytes=0
redirect_stderr=true
```

Two deliberate choices:

- **`--timeout 0`** keeps the daemon(s) in the foreground (they would
  otherwise self-exit on idle). Required for supervisord to manage
  them. `libvirtd --timeout 0` behaves identically to the modular
  daemons (RDD-verified on debian:13).
- **No `user=` directive.** The supervisord programs inherit the parent
  supervisord's uid. On `charly-fedora`/`charly-arch`/`githubrunner`,
  supervisord runs as uid 0 → daemons run as uid 0 →
  `qemu:///session` targets root's session. On `openclaw-desktop`,
  supervisord runs as uid 1000 → daemons run as uid 1000 →
  `qemu:///session` targets user's session. Both work because the
  session URI keys off `$XDG_RUNTIME_DIR` rather than a fixed socket
  path.

Priority 5/6 places the daemon(s) ahead of every desktop program
(labwc=12, selkies=18) so the session socket is available by the time
any later service or shell tries to connect.

See `/charly-build:generate` for the supervisord `fragment_assembly` init model
that emits these program blocks into `.build/<image>/supervisor/NN-virtualization.conf`.

## Rootless libvirt — `qemu:///session`

`charly/vm.go:22` already hardcodes `qemu:///session` as the charly default.
This candy makes that URI actually work inside a container at uid
1000:

- No `CAP_SYS_ADMIN` required on the outer container.
- No `security_opt` relaxation beyond what `/charly-distros:container-nesting` contributes (and even that isn't needed for VMs alone).
- Only `/dev/kvm` must be passed through. On the host, it's typically
  `crw-rw-rw-` (world-readable/writable), so any uid that can `open()` it
  gets KVM acceleration.
- `virsh -c qemu:///session domcapabilities` reports
  `<domain>kvm</domain>` once the daemons are running — verified
  on `openclaw-desktop` at uid 1000.

## Tests baked into the candy

**Build-scope (run by `charly check box <image>` without deploying):**

- `virtqemud-package` / `virtnetworkd-package` — package-existence probes using `package:` + `package_map:` (see below).
- `virsh-binary` — `/usr/bin/virsh` exists.
- `qemu-system-x86-binary` — `/usr/bin/qemu-system-x86_64` exists.
- `qemu-img-binary` — `/usr/bin/qemu-img` exists.

### Why package-existence, not binary-path, for the virtqemud/virtnetworkd tests

Debian/Ubuntu and Fedora/Arch bundle libvirt drivers differently. On Fedora/Arch the `libvirt-daemon-driver-qemu` / `libvirt-daemon-driver-network` subpackages ship `/usr/sbin/virtqemud` and `/usr/sbin/virtnetworkd` as standalone binaries. On Debian/Ubuntu those drivers are bundled inside `libvirt-daemon-system`, and the monolithic `libvirtd` binary replaces the per-driver split daemons — so a `file: /usr/sbin/virtqemud` probe hard-fails on deb even when the functionality is present.

The fix probes package presence with distro-specific names:

```yaml
- id: virtqemud-package
  package: libvirt-daemon-driver-qemu     # rpm name on Fedora
  package_map:
    arch: libvirt                    # Arch bundles into 'libvirt' metapackage
    debian: libvirt-daemon-system         # deb bundles all drivers here
    ubuntu: libvirt-daemon-system
  installed: true
```

See `/charly-check:check` "`package:` + `package_map:` pattern" for the resolution order (tag > base name > fallback).

**Deploy-scope (run against a live `charly start`ed container):**

- `virtqemud-running` — supervisorctl reports RUNNING.
- `virtnetworkd-running` — supervisorctl reports RUNNING.
- `libvirt-session-list` — `virsh -c qemu:///session list --all` exits 0.
- `libvirt-kvm-acceleration` — `virsh -c qemu:///session domcapabilities | grep -c '<domain>kvm</domain>'` ≥ 1.

## Usage

```yaml
# charly.yml — rootless nested VM image
openclaw-desktop:
  candy:
    - ...
    - charly                  # the full toolchain — pulls virtualization
    - container-nesting   # donates /dev/fuse + /dev/net/tun devices (VMs only need /dev/kvm)
```

`/dev/kvm` is auto-detected at `charly shell`/`charly start` time by
`charly/devices.go` (scans `/dev/kvm`, `/dev/fuse`, `/dev/dri/renderD*`,
`/dev/net/tun`, `/dev/vhost-*`, `/dev/hwrng`) — no box-level
`security.devices:` entry needed for the typical deployment.

## Composition chain

The `charly` candy (the full toolchain) composes `virtualization` (this candy) +
the charly binary + `gocryptfs` + `socat` + `podman-machine` + `gvisor-tap-vsock`.
So any box that pulls `charly` automatically gets the supervisord-managed
virtqemud/virtnetworkd programs.

## Cross-distro coverage

Packages are declared under the candy's `distro:` map — `distro.fedora` (RPM), `distro.arch` (pacman), `distro.debian` / `distro.ubuntu` / `distro.ubuntu-24.04` (deb). Debian/Ubuntu install `libvirt-daemon-system`, `libvirt-clients`, `libvirt-daemon-driver-qemu`, `qemu-system-x86`, `qemu-utils`, `virtinst`. Crucially, **Debian/Ubuntu build libvirt WITHOUT the modular split** — there is NO `/usr/sbin/virtqemud`/`/usr/sbin/virtnetworkd` binary and NO `virtqemud.socket`/`virtnetworkd.socket` unit (RDD-proven on debian:13 / libvirt 11.3.0); only the monolithic `/usr/sbin/libvirtd` + `libvirtd.socket` exist, and `libvirtd` serves both the qemu and network drivers. That is exactly why the `service:` block scopes the `virtqemud`/`virtnetworkd` entries to `distro: [fedora, arch]` and ships a distinct `libvirtd` entry scoped to `distro: [debian, ubuntu]` (see the canonical example above). The `package_map:` on the `virtqemud`/`virtnetworkd` package-existence checks resolves the deb name to `libvirt-daemon-system`.

Drops on deb: `gvisor-tap-vsock`, `podman-machine` (not packaged; VM-mode networking features degrade gracefully on debian-coder / ubuntu-coder).

## Used In Boxes

- `/charly-openclaw:openclaw-desktop` — rootless VM host inside a streaming desktop
- `/charly-distros:charly-fedora` — root VM host (same daemons, uid 0)
- `/charly-coder:charly-arch` — Arch counterpart
- `/charly-coder:debian-coder`, `/charly-coder:ubuntu-coder` — deb-based consumers (via the `charly` candy)
- `/charly-distros:githubrunner` — VMs for CI workloads

## Related Candies

- `/charly-tools:charly` — the full toolchain that pulls this candy into charly-toolchain boxes
- `/charly-distros:container-nesting` — pairs with this candy for boxes that need both nested containers AND nested VMs; also donates `/dev/kvm`-adjacent devices
- `/charly-infrastructure:socat` — part of the `charly` candy alongside virtualization; used for VM console/hostfwd relays
- `/charly-infrastructure:gocryptfs` — part of the `charly` candy; for encrypting VM disk storage

## Related Commands

- `/charly-vm:vm` — VM lifecycle (build, create, start, stop, ssh, console, destroy); defaults to `qemu:///session` at charly/vm.go:22
- `/charly-build:generate` — Containerfile generation; emits the supervisord `NN-virtualization.conf` fragment via `fragment_assembly` init model
- `/charly-image:layer` — candy authoring reference (tasks, vars, service blocks, tests syntax)
- `/charly-check:check` — declarative testing framework for the candy's `check:` block (file, service, command verbs)

## When to Use This Skill

**MUST be invoked** when:

- Adding VM support to any box (this candy donates the daemons + packages).
- Debugging `virsh -c qemu:///session` connection failures — the two
  most common causes are supervisord not yet started the daemons (check
  `supervisorctl status virtqemud`) or `/dev/kvm` not passed through
  (check `ls -la /dev/kvm` inside the container).
- Running `charly vm` from inside a rootless container (the
  supervisord-managed daemons here are what makes that work).
- Understanding why this candy is a service provider, not just a
  package installer — it ships the supervisord programs + `require:
  supervisord` + the deploy-scope tests on top of the QEMU/libvirt
  packages.
