  Tailscale runtime wiring for target:local hosts. Sets `--operator=$account`
  + `--hostname=$(hostname -s)` so user-systemd ExecStartPost can run
  `tailscale serve` without sudo, and the tailnet device name stays in sync
  with the system hostname. Depends on /charly-infrastructure:tailscale (which
  installs the daemon). Self-gates on `systemctl is-active tailscaled`
  so it's a no-op in image-build / pre-auth contexts.
  Use when adding deploy-runtime tailscale wiring to a target:local host
  (canonical consumer: local.charly-cachyos) — distinct from the tailscale candy
  which only installs + enables the daemon.

# tailscale-up — runtime wiring for target:local hosts

## Why this candy exists separately from `tailscale`

The `tailscale` candy installs the daemon and enables the systemd unit.
That's a **build-time** concern shared by bootc images, VMs, and any
other box that wants its own tailnet identity at boot.

The `--operator` and `--hostname` settings, however, are **runtime
state** that:

- Cannot be applied at image build time (the daemon isn't running, so
  `tailscale set` has no socket to talk to).
- Are meaningless on bootc images that have no human "deploy user"
  matching uid 1000.
- Need re-application across hostname changes (`hostnamectl set-hostname
  new-name` doesn't propagate to the tailnet device name automatically).

Mixing those concerns into the shared `tailscale` candy would either
break bootc consumers (with build-time errors from missing daemon
socket) or require a target-aware conditional inside the shared candy
— exactly the kind of `<name>-host` polymorphism that CLAUDE.md's
"Init-system polymorphism" rule forbids.

`tailscale-up` is the runtime-config sibling: it depends on `tailscale`,
self-gates on `systemctl is-active tailscaled`, and only fires when
the daemon is actually up. Bootc consumers don't include it.

## Candy Properties

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| Dependencies | `tailscale` |
| Packages | none (config-only layer) |
| Service | none (sets state on existing `tailscaled.service`) |
| Install files | `task:` (one cmd task) |

## Task body

The candy's single cmd task:

1. **Starts `tailscaled.service`** via `systemctl start ... || true`.
   The `/charly-infrastructure:tailscale` candy is `systemctl enable`-only
   (no `--now`) because the same task body runs at image-build time
   where systemd isn't PID 1 and `--now` would fail; starting the
   service is therefore a deploy-runtime concern that belongs in this
   candy. Idempotent — no-op when already running, suppressed when
   no live systemd is available.
2. Self-gates on `systemctl is-active --quiet tailscaled || exit 0`
   so the rest of the body is a no-op in any context where the daemon
   isn't running (image build, masked unit, etc.).
3. Resolves the human deploy user via `getent passwd 1000 | cut -d: -f1`.
   This matches the `wheel-nopasswd` candy and the
   `renderBuilderScript` helper in `charly/deploy_host_helpers.go` — uid 1000
   is the canonical "first human user" in this repo across CachyOS,
   Arch, Fedora, Debian, and Ubuntu base images. `SUDO_USER` is
   intentionally NOT used: `runSudoShell` calls `sudo -n bash -s`
   without `-E`, so the default `env_reset` strips `SUDO_USER` on
   strict sudoers configurations.
4. Calls `tailscale set --operator="$account"` (suppressed via `|| true`
   so a logged-out daemon doesn't fail the deploy).
5. Reads `/etc/hostname` directly (NOT `hostname -s` — the `hostname`
   binary lives in Arch's `inetutils` package, which is NOT in the
   minimal cloud-image base used by the `check-arch-vm` R10 bed; reading the
   file is binary-dependency-free and works on every distro). Calls
   `tailscale set --hostname=<short-form>` (also suppressed) to keep
   the tailnet device name in sync with the system hostname; the short
   form is the value before the first dot, matching `hostname -s`
   semantics.

## Check probes

Both deploy-scope probes use a three-state pattern:

- (a) Daemon down → pass-skip (image-build context, fresh test bed
  pre-deploy).
- (b) Daemon up + tailscale logged out → pass-skip (test bed
  post-deploy, no `tailscale up` performed).
- (c) Daemon up + tailscale logged in → assert.

The "logged in" detection uses `tailscale status --peers=false |
head -1 | grep -q "Logged out"` — false means logged-in.

`tailscale-up-operator-readable`: when logged in, asserts that
`tailscale debug prefs` succeeds AND emits a non-empty
`"OperatorUser":` line. Calling `debug prefs` without sudo is itself
the proof that `--operator` took effect (operator-or-root is the
authorization policy).

`tailscale-up-hostname-tracks-system`: when logged in, asserts that
the prefs `Hostname` field equals `hostname -s`.

## Used in

- `local.charly-cachyos` — primary consumer, applies it on every fresh
  CachyOS dev workstation.
- Any future `target: local` template that needs tailnet operator
  permission.

NOT used in:

- Any `target: pod` deployment — pod tunnels go through the
  `tunnel: tailscale` mechanism in `charly.yml` (handled by the host's
  tailscale, not in-pod). See `/charly-core:deploy` "Tailscale Serve".
- Bootc images — they need fresh-boot semantics that don't match the
  deploy-runtime contract here. Use `/charly-infrastructure:tailscale` alone.

## Renaming an already-registered device — and why the candy doesn't auto-fix

`tailscale set --hostname=<X>` updates local prefs and is what the
candy task does on every deploy. For a **fresh** node that has not
yet run `tailscale up`, the prefs Hostname is what gets registered
with the control plane on first auth — so the tailnet device name
matches `/etc/hostname` automatically.

For a node that **was already authed before this candy landed**, the
device name on the tailnet is the value registered at original
`tailscale up` time and DOES NOT auto-rename when prefs.Hostname
changes. This is **intentional Tailscale design** — names are sticky
in the control plane to keep ACL rules, DNS caches, and audit trails
stable across reconfigurations. The local prefs are updated correctly
(visible via `tailscale debug prefs | grep Hostname`), but
`tailscale status` keeps showing the old name.

The candy surfaces this divergence as a hard-fail check probe
(`tailscale-up-device-name-matches-hostname`). On every `charly check live
<deploy>` against a logged-in tailnet member, the probe compares the
short form of `tailscale status --self --json | .DNSName` against
`/etc/hostname` (cut to short form). If they differ, the probe fails
with stderr text identifying the registered device, the system
hostname, and both remediation paths. The probe self-gates on daemon
state (skips on a logged-out daemon) so test beds aren't affected.

### Two remediation paths (operator action required)

1. **Admin-console rename** at https://login.tailscale.com/admin/machines
   — pick the device, click the kebab menu, "Edit machine name". Safe,
   no service interruption, no re-auth, preserves exit-node config and
   all other prefs. **Recommended** for any node with non-default flags.

2. **`sudo tailscale up --reset --hostname=$(cat /etc/hostname | cut -d. -f1)`** —
   re-registers the device with the prefs Hostname.
   **WARNING**: `--reset` clears every non-default flag (exit-node
   config, advertised routes, accept-routes, accept-DNS-override,
   advertise-tags, etc.). Only use this on a node where every flag is
   at its Tailscale default.

### Why the candy doesn't auto-rename

The candy **does not** reach for `tailscale up --reset` automatically
because:

- It wipes operator-set prefs that the candy can't enumerate or
  preserve (exit-node config, advertised routes, accept-routes are
  typical examples).
- It triggers a brief disconnect + re-auth attempt, which can fail on
  ephemeral auth keys or expire-on-rotate setups.
- It violates CLAUDE.md's "no ad-hoc workarounds" rule: a `--reset` to
  fix a name divergence is a sledgehammer for a problem better solved
  by an admin-console click or a deliberate operator-driven `up`.

A proper auto-rename would require the Tailscale REST API
(`PATCH https://api.tailscale.com/api/v2/device/{id}/name`) plus an
operator-managed PAT or OAuth secret — significant credential-
management scope. If a future need arises for fully-automated rename
(fleet provisioning, CI runners), that's the right path; today's
manual remediation covers the actual single-host case.

## Bring-up flow for a fresh CachyOS host

```bash
# 1. Apply the charly-cachyos template — installs everything, including
#    tailscale (daemon enabled) + tailscale-up (operator/hostname
#    setters armed for next-time-up state changes).
charly bundle add charly-cachyos

# 2. Authenticate the daemon via the user's tailnet (browser SSO):
sudo tailscale up

# 3. Verify operator + hostname are wired correctly:
tailscale debug prefs | grep -E '"OperatorUser"|"Hostname"'
tailscale status | head -2

# 4. Optional re-apply (idempotent) to confirm the runtime task takes
#    effect now that the daemon is logged in:
charly bundle add charly-cachyos
```

Subsequent `charly bundle add charly-cachyos` invocations re-run the runtime
task and re-confirm the operator + hostname state. Hostname changes
(`sudo hostnamectl set-hostname new-name`) propagate to the tailnet
on the next deploy.

## MagicDNS

MagicDNS is a tailnet-account-level toggle, not a per-node setting.
Enable it once at https://login.tailscale.com/admin/dns ; every node
logging in to the tailnet automatically gets `100.100.100.100` as a
DNS server (visible via `resolvectl status | grep '100.100.100.100'`)
and the `*.ts.net` magic search domain.

`tailscale-up` does not touch DNS state — `tailscale up` (run manually
post-deploy) handles the per-node resolver wiring automatically on
systemd-resolved hosts (which CachyOS uses).

## `tailscale serve` for pod deploys — direct, no restart

The `--operator` permission this candy wires is what makes the
**direct, host-level `tailscale serve` workflow** work without
sudo. For each pod that publishes a host port (e.g. immich-ml on
2283, ollama on 11434), one shell command on the host adds it to
the tailnet:

```bash
tailscale serve --bg --https=2283 http://127.0.0.1:2283
tailscale serve --bg --https=11434 http://127.0.0.1:11434
# ... one line per pod port
```

Each invocation writes to `tailscaled.state` (the daemon's local
BoltDB) and starts a listener on the tailscale interface that
forwards to the pre-existing host-loopback socket. **Nothing about
the pod changes — no quadlet regen, no restart, no daemon-reload,
no port re-publish.** The pod's published port on `127.0.0.1` was
always already there; `tailscale serve` simply adds a new path INTO
it from the tailnet.

To list current serves and their backends:

```bash
tailscale serve status
```

To remove a serve:

```bash
tailscale serve --https=2283 off
```

The serve config is persisted in the daemon's state and survives
restarts, so a one-time setup is durable. Re-running with the same
args is idempotent (replaces the existing entry verbatim).

### Compared to the per-pod `tunnel: tailscale` charly.yml mechanism

`/charly-core:deploy` documents a `tunnel: tailscale` field that emits
`ExecStartPost=tailscale serve ...` into the pod's quadlet. That
also works and is the right answer when (a) you want the serve
config tied to the pod's lifecycle (added on `charly config`, removed
on `charly remove`), or (b) you're willing to regenerate the quadlet
and restart the pod. For the more common "I have running pods, I
want them on the tailnet right now" case, the direct `tailscale
serve` workflow above is faster, restartless, and doesn't touch
any source-tree state.

See `/charly-core:deploy` "Tailscale Serve" for the per-pod tunnel
matrix and `/charly-automation:sidecar` for the tailscale-sidecar pattern
(an alternative when a pod needs its own tailnet identity, not just
host-level serve).

## When to Use This Skill

Use when the user asks about:

- Why `tailscale serve` fails with "permission denied" on a fresh
  charly-cachyos host.
- How to keep the tailnet device name in sync with `hostname -s`.
- The split between the build-time tailscale install and the
  deploy-time tailscale wiring.
- Writing a new candy that adds runtime configuration on top of an
  install-side candy (this is the canonical worked example).
