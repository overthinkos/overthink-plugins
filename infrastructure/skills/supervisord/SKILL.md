# supervisord -- process manager

## Candy Properties

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| Dependencies | **(none)** — system Python comes from the `supervisor` RPM's own dep |
| Install files | `charly.yml`, `supervisord.header.conf` (via the embedded `init:` vocabulary's `header_file:`) |
| Init role | Default init system for container images (set in the embedded `init:` vocabulary) |

## Packages

- `supervisor` (RPM) — process control system. The RPM brings
  `/usr/bin/python3` as its own dependency; supervisord's shebang is
  `/usr/bin/python3`. **No pixi-python / no conda-forge Python env is
  needed.**
- `supervisor` (pac) — same package name on Arch (`extra/` repo), same
  system-Python dependency.

### No `require: python`

This layer declares no `require: python`. supervisord's runtime is
pure system-Python (the `supervisor` RPM brings `/usr/bin/python3`
as its own dependency), so it needs no `python` charly-layer → `pixi`
charly-layer → conda-forge Python env (~500 MB). See CLAUDE.md
"Key Rules" → *"Don't declare defensive deps"* for the general rule.

**Arch note:** the `pac: [supervisor]` section is required so that
Arch-based images with `build: [pac]` actually install supervisord.
Without it, an Arch image gets a `/etc/supervisord.conf` with no
`supervisord` binary, and the quadlet's `supervisord -n -c /etc/supervisord.conf`
exits 127 (command not found) at container start. Every Arch-rooted
auto-intermediate that composes `supervisord` needs it.

## How `charly` Generates Supervisord Configs

Candies declare processes via the unified **`service:`** schema in `charly.yml` (see `/charly-image:layer` "Service Declaration"). Each entry is rendered through supervisord's `service_schema.service_template` in the embedded build vocabulary, which produces a `[program:<name>]` INI fragment. `charly box generate` collects all rendered fragments across the candy chain and writes them into `/etc/supervisord.conf` inside the image, prefixed by the header from `templates/supervisord.header.conf` (referenced from the embedded `init:` vocabulary).

```yaml
# candy/chrome/charly.yml — node-form: the service: list lives in a <candy>-service child node
chrome-service:
  service:
    - name: chrome
      exec: /home/user/.local/bin/chrome-wrapper --force-renderer-accessibility --no-first-run --start-maximized
      restart: always
      user: user
      env:
        # ...
      priority: 50                  # supervisord-specific; ordering hint
      stdout: file:/tmp/supervisor-chrome.log
      scope: system
      enable: true
```

The render template maps the abstract spec to supervisord INI:

| `service:` field | Supervisord output |
|---|---|
| `exec` | `command=` |
| `env` | `environment=K="V",K2="V2"` |
| `restart: always` | `autorestart=true` (helper `supervisordRestart`) |
| `restart: on-failure` | `autorestart=unexpected` |
| `restart: no` / unset | `autorestart=false` |
| `working_directory` | `directory=` |
| `user` | `user=` |
| `priority` | `priority=` (supervisord-specific) |
| `stop_timeout` | `stopwaitsecs=` |
| `stdout: file:/path` | `stdout_logfile=/path` (helper `supervisordLog`) |
| `stdout: journal` / unset | `stdout_logfile=/dev/stdout` |

**Supervisord does NOT support `use_packaged:`** — it doesn't consume systemd units. Entries with `use_packaged:` are skipped with a warning when rendering into a supervisord-init image. Use a custom entry (with explicit `exec:`) on supervisord-init images, or target a systemd init (bootc / `target: local`) where `use_packaged:` is honored.

The rendered INI lands at `/etc/supervisord.d/<layer>-<name>.conf` and is assembled into `/etc/supervisord.conf` at container-build time via the init system's fragment pipeline (the embedded `init.supervisord.fragment_template` + `stage_fragment_copy`).

At runtime, PID 1 is `supervisord`. The container's lifecycle is the supervisord process's lifecycle — when supervisord exits, the container exits (and the systemd quadlet's `Restart=always` rebuilds it).

### `service:` declaration

Layers declare services under a single `service:` key (singular; value is a list of `ServiceEntry`). Two entry shapes: `use_packaged:` reuses a distro-shipped systemd unit; custom exec (with `exec:`, `env:`, `restart:`, …) renders via the init-system's `service_template:`.

**Supervisord lifecycle directives on ServiceEntry** (all optional — render only when set):

| Field | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `kind: eventlistener` | Emits `[eventlistener:...]` instead of `[program:...]`; use with `events:`. |
| `events:` | Supervisord eventlistener trigger list (e.g. `PROCESS_STATE_FATAL`). |
| `auto_start:` | Tri-state bool. `false` for services hand-started by another program. |
| `start_retries:` | Max restart attempts before FATAL. The selkies `[program:chrome]` uses `3`. |
| `start_secs:` | Seconds the process must stay up to count as "started." |
| `stop_signal:` | TERM (default), INT, HUP, … |
| `exit_code:` | Success codes for `restart: no` / `on-failure`. |
| `priority:` | Startup order; lower = earlier. |

See `/charly-selkies:selkies-core` for the canonical consumer (the supervised `[program:chrome]` service: `restart: always` + `start_secs`/`start_retries`).

## Polymorphism: a candy that runs on BOTH supervisord and systemd

A candy that needs the SAME service to run under supervisord (container/pod targets) AND systemd (host installs / bootc / VMs) must NOT spin up a `<name>-host` sibling candy. The supported pattern is **mixed entries in one `service:` list**: same `name:`, two entries — one with `use_packaged: <unit>.service` (or `.socket`) for the systemd render, the other with custom `exec:` for the supervisord render. Init system at deploy time picks the matching form; the other entry is silently skipped. See `/charly-image:layer` "Service Declaration" → "Mixed entries in one candy" for the schema, CLAUDE.md "Init-system polymorphism via mixed `service:` entries" for the project-wide rule, and `/charly-infrastructure:virtualization` for the canonical worked example.

It is tempting to copy-paste-and-rename a candy with a `-host` suffix when the schema already supports polymorphism via mixed entries. If you find yourself reaching for `-host`, reach for a second `service:` entry instead.

## Service Priority & Ordering

Supervisord starts programs in **priority order** (ascending). Candies set priorities explicitly so that dependency chains come up in the right order:

| Priority | Typical services |
|----------|------------------|
| `1-9` | System-level: dbus, pipewire |
| `10` | Compositors: sway, labwc |
| `15-20` | Desktop extras: waybar, swaync |
| `30-50` | Applications: chrome, openclaw, hermes |
| `100` | Auxiliary: cdp-proxy, chrome-devtools-mcp |
| `200+` | Last-start daemons: event listeners |

Programs with no `priority=` default to 999 and start last.

## autostart / autorestart / startretries

The knobs that shape crash-recovery behavior:

- `autostart=true` (default) — Start at container boot. Use `autostart=false` only for services that must be hand-started by another program. (Services that just need a Wayland compositor up first don't need this — e.g. the selkies `[program:chrome]` service in `selkies-core` stays `autostart=true` and self-synchronizes by polling for the compositor's `wayland-0` socket inside `chrome-wrapper`.)
- `autorestart=true` (default) — Restart the program when it exits non-zero. Combined with `startretries`, this creates a crash-retry loop.
- `startretries=N` (default 3) — How many consecutive restarts supervisord will attempt before declaring the program `FATAL`. Once FATAL, supervisord stops trying.
- `startsecs=N` (default 1) — How long the program must stay up before supervisord considers the start "successful." Crashes within `startsecs` count against `startretries`; crashes after reset the counter.

**A program that can't stay up for `startsecs` seconds, `startretries` times in a row, is marked FATAL** and a `PROCESS_STATE_FATAL` event is emitted — which is what the event listener pattern below catches.

## Event Listeners

Supervisord supports a **plugin model** for reacting to process state changes: event listeners are separate programs that subscribe to events and can take arbitrary action. They run as supervisord programs themselves (using `[eventlistener:<name>]` instead of `[program:<name>]`) and communicate with supervisord over stdin/stdout using a simple protocol.

### Crash-escalation eventlistener (the pattern)

A `PROCESS_STATE_FATAL` listener is the supervisord pattern for escalating a
program that has exhausted its `startretries` budget. The classic action is to
terminate supervisord (PID 1) so the systemd quadlet's `Restart=always` rebuilds
the whole container — the only way to flush cgroup-level orphan memfd shmem (from
e.g. a Chrome crash loop) that a per-program restart can't release:

```ini
[eventlistener:crash-escalate]
command=/path/to/crash-escalate-listener
events=PROCESS_STATE_FATAL
autostart=true
autorestart=true
priority=200
user=user
```

No candy ships such a listener today. The selkies `[program:chrome]` service
(in `selkies-core`, `restart: always`, `start_secs: 5`/`start_retries: 3`) relies
on supervisord's ordinary relaunch for ordinary exits; a genuinely wedged crash
loop is cleared by restarting the container (`charly update` / `charly restart`), which tears down the cgroup. The chrome candy's
`security.memory_max`/`memory_high`/`memory_swap_max` caps bound the blast radius.
See `/charly-selkies:chrome` (Chrome supervision) and `/charly-image:layer` (Security
Declaration → resource caps).

### Event listener protocol (for authoring your own)

An event listener is a shell script or Python program that:

1. Writes `READY\n` to stdout to tell supervisord it's ready for an event.
2. Reads a header line from stdin (format: `ver:3.0 server:supervisor serial:N pool:name poolserial:M eventname:NAME len:L`).
3. Reads `L` bytes of payload from stdin.
4. Takes action (log, email, kill PID 1, restart a service, etc.).
5. Writes `RESULT 2\nOK` to stdout.
6. Loops back to step 1.

Full protocol details: [supervisord event listener docs](http://supervisord.org/events.html). `supervisorctl avail` lists both regular programs and event listeners.

## Diagnostics

```bash
# Inside container
supervisorctl status           # All programs + states
supervisorctl avail            # All defined programs (including stopped)
supervisorctl pid              # Supervisord's own PID — best liveness probe
supervisorctl tail -f chrome stderr  # Live stderr log for one program
supervisorctl restart chrome   # Restart a single program (does not reset startretries counter)

# From host
charly service status <image>      # Wraps supervisorctl status via charly shell
charly service start/stop/restart <image> <name>   # Per-program control
charly logs <image>                # Container-level stdout/stderr (supervisord output)
```

### Declarative-testing liveness check

**`supervisorctl status` returns exit 3 when ANY program is non-RUNNING**
(FATAL, STOPPED, or EXITED). Candies with `autostart=false` programs
(e.g. `hermes` ships `hermes-whatsapp` as autostart=false) will always
fail a naive `command: supervisorctl status; exit_status: 0` test.

The robust liveness probe is `supervisorctl pid`, which asks
supervisord for its own PID and exits 0 iff the socket responds:

```yaml
# node-form: each step is its own child node (no plan: list key)
supervisord-step-6:
  check: supervisord's control socket responds
  command: supervisorctl pid
  exit_status: 0
  in_container: true
  context:
    - runtime
```

This is the deterministic `check:` step node the current supervisord candy
ships (`supervisord-step-6`).
See `/charly-check:check` Authoring Gotcha #4.

**Also note**: `pgrep` is NOT installed by default in minimal images
(needs `procps-ng`). The `process: <name>; running: true` test verb
silently fails when pgrep is absent. Prefer `service:` (which uses
supervisorctl internally) for program-liveness checks. See `/charly-check:check`
Authoring Gotcha #3.

`supervisorctl avail | grep -q '^<name>\b'` is the idiomatic way to check whether a program is defined (as opposed to whether it's currently running). This is what labwc's autostart uses to decide whether to hand off Chrome to supervisord or fall back to a direct launch — see `/charly-selkies:labwc` (autostart Chrome-duplication race) for the canonical pattern.

## Header File

`templates/supervisord.header.conf` (at the repo root) defines global `[supervisord]`, `[unix_http_server]`, `[supervisorctl]`, and `[rpcinterface:supervisor]` sections. It's referenced from the embedded `init:` vocabulary as the init system's `header_file:` and prepended to every generated `supervisord.conf`. Common fields:

- `[unix_http_server] file=/tmp/supervisor.sock` — the socket `supervisorctl` uses
- `[supervisord] nodaemon=true logfile=/tmp/supervisord.log pidfile=/tmp/supervisord.pid`
- `[supervisord] user=user` — supervisord runs as the container user, not root

## Cross-distro coverage

RPM: `supervisor` (Fedora) · PAC: `supervisor` (Arch community) · DEB: `supervisor` (Debian/Ubuntu — package is named `supervisor`, not `supervisord`). Full parity; the process manager itself plus the header template is identical across distros. The `[supervisord] user=user` line in `templates/supervisord.header.conf` is a fallback only — when `user_policy: adopt` fires on an ubuntu base image, supervisord inherits the adopted `ubuntu` identity at runtime via the USER directive, so `user=user` in the header is harmless (supervisord's `user=` field is advisory — uid passthrough from the Dockerfile USER directive takes precedence).

## Usage

```yaml
# charly.yml — a box composes candies through a <box>-candy child node
my-image:
  candy:
    base: fedora
  my-image-candy:
    candy:
      - supervisord
      - my-service  # layers with service: entries need supervisord
```

Adding a `service:` block to a candy automatically pulls in `supervisord` via the embedded `init:` vocabulary's `depends_candy`. You rarely add `supervisord` to a box's `candy:` list manually.

## Used In Boxes

Transitive dependency for all boxes with managed services, including:
`openclaw`, `jupyter`, `jupyter-ml`, `jupyter-ml-notebook`, `ollama`, `comfyui`, `immich`, `immich-ml`, `selkies-desktop`, `selkies-labwc-nvidia`, `hermes`, `openwebui`, `filebrowser`.

## Running supervisord under systemd (bootc mode)

On non-bootc images, supervisord is container PID 1 (`ENTRYPOINT=supervisord` emitted by the init system definition in the embedded build vocabulary). On **bootc** images, systemd is PID 1, which means supervisord needs a systemd unit wrapper — otherwise the whole desktop tier never starts. The wrapper is a systemd **user** unit at `/etc/systemd/user/supervisord.service`, `systemctl --global enable`d so tty1 autologin brings it up (a linger sentinel file keeps it alive across logouts).

### Two gotchas specific to running under a systemd user service

Both involve opening `/dev/stdout` or `/dev/fd/1`, which resolve to the journal pipe under a systemd user service — and `open()` on a pipe returns ENXIO.

1. **Main supervisord logfile.** The header template (`templates/supervisord.header.conf`) was changed from `logfile=/dev/stdout` to `logfile=/tmp/supervisord.log`. `/dev/stdout` works when supervisord is PID 1 in a container (fd 1 is real stdio), but fails with `OSError: [Errno 6] No such device or address: '/dev/stdout'` under a systemd user service where fd 1 is a pipe. Writing to a regular file works everywhere.
2. **Per-program `stdout_logfile=/dev/fd/1`.** Every candy's `service:` fragment redirects program stdout to `/dev/fd/1` so container logs (`charly logs <image>`) show per-program output. Under a systemd user service this fails with `unknown error making dispatchers for <name>: ENXIO` for every program. The fix lives in the systemd user unit itself — set `StandardOutput=file:/tmp/supervisord-stdout.log` so supervisord's fd 1 backs a real file, not a pipe. Existing per-program `/dev/fd/1` lines then resolve correctly.

Container-mode logs are unaffected — supervisord is still PID 1 there.

- Supervisord configuration or process management
- Running multiple services in a container
- Service startup order (priority ordering)
- autostart / autorestart / startretries behavior and crash-loop recovery
- Event listeners (the `PROCESS_STATE_FATAL` crash-escalation pattern)
- `supervisorctl` commands (`status`, `avail`, `start`, `tail`, `restart`)
- The `charly service` commands (start/stop/restart/status)
- The `supervisor` RPM package or `/tmp/supervisor.sock`
