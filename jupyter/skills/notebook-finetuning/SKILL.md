# notebook-finetuning -- Unsloth fine-tuning notebook data candy

## Candy Properties

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| Dependencies | *(none)* |
| Packages | *(none)* |
| Services | *(none)* |
| Volumes | `workspace` -> `/workspace` (from unsloth-studio) |
| Data | `data/finetuning` -> `workspace` volume, dest: `finetuning` |
| Install files | *(none)* |

## How It Works

This is a **data candy** — it uses the `data:` field in `charly.yml` to map a directory of notebooks to a named volume with a subdirectory destination:

```yaml
info: "Unsloth fine-tuning notebook collection for unsloth-studio"

data:
  - src: data/finetuning
    volume: workspace
    dest: finetuning
```

At build time, the contents of `data/finetuning/` are staged into `/data/workspace/finetuning/` inside the box.

At deploy time, when the workspace volume is configured as a bind mount (`charly config --bind workspace`), `charly config` copies the staged data into the host-backed volume directory at `<workspace>/finetuning/`. This seeds the volume with ready-to-use training notebooks.

The `dest: finetuning` field places the notebooks in a subdirectory rather than the volume root, keeping the workspace organized alongside other content.

## Included Data

37 Jupyter notebooks + 1 manifest, organized by training category:

| Category | Notebooks | Models |
|----------|-----------|--------|
| 00-Setup | `00_Unsloth_Setup.ipynb` | *(general)* |
| 01-FastInference | 3 notebooks | Llama, Qwen, Qwen_Think |
| 02-Vision Training | 2 notebooks | Ministral, Pixtral |
| 03-SFT Training | 5 notebooks | Ministral (text + vision), Pixtral, Qwen, Qwen_Think |
| 04-GRPO Training | 5 notebooks | Ministral (text + vision), Pixtral, Qwen, Qwen_Think |
| 05-DPO Training | 2 notebooks | Qwen, Qwen_Think |
| 06-Reward Training | 2 notebooks | Qwen, Qwen_Think |
| 07-RLOO Training | 5 notebooks | Ministral (text + vision), Pixtral, Qwen, Qwen_Think |
| 08-QLoRA | 12 notebooks | Ministral, Qwen_Think (alpha scaling, continual learning, rank comparison, multi-adapter, quantization comparison, target modules) |

**Manifest:** `notebooks.yaml` — structured catalog of all notebooks with metadata.

## Usage

```yaml
# charly.yml
unsloth-studio:
  candy:
    - unsloth-studio
    - notebook-finetuning
    # ... other candies
```

```bash
# Deploy with bind-backed workspace volume
charly config unsloth-studio --bind workspace

# Notebooks are seeded at <workspace>/finetuning/ on first config
charly start unsloth-studio
# Open http://localhost:8888 → navigate to finetuning/
```

## Notebook Compatibility Fixes

The notebooks include several workarounds for upstream library changes:

- **`packing=True` in SFTConfig** (19 notebooks) -- Required for TRL 1.0 compatibility. Without it, SFT training fails with the updated TRL API
- **`os.environ["UNSLOTH_ENABLE_FLEX_ATTENTION"] = "0"`** (16 Ministral/Pixtral notebooks) -- Disables flex_attention to work around a transformers 5.5 bug that crashes these model architectures
- **`max_memory={0: "14GB"}` in model loading** (3 Pixtral-12B notebooks) -- Fixes accelerate device_map estimation for Pixtral-12B models that would otherwise OOM
- **`max_prompt_length` removed from DPOConfig** (2 DPO notebooks) -- Parameter deprecated and removed in TRL 1.0

## When to Use This Skill

Use when the user asks about:

- The notebook-finetuning candy or its contents
- Unsloth fine-tuning notebook templates or training workflows
- How training notebooks get provisioned into the workspace volume
- The `data:` field with `dest:` subdirectory mapping
- Which models and training methods are covered by the notebook collection
