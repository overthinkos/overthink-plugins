# jupyter-mcp -- JupyterLab CRDT MCP server extension

## Candy Properties

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| Dependencies | *(none)* |
| Packages | *(none -- pip-only Tier 1 candy)* |
| Services | *(none)* |
| Volumes | *(none)* |
| Install files | `charly.yml`, `task:`, `jupyter_mcp/` (Python package) |

## Architecture: Tier 1 Post-Install Layer

This is a **Tier 1 "post-install"** layer — it has no `pixi.toml` and installs into whatever pixi environment exists from the parent Tier 2 candy. It follows the same pattern as `llama-cpp` and `unsloth`.

**Single source of truth:** The `jupyter_mcp` Python package lives only in this candy. Both `jupyter` (lightweight) and `jupyter-ml` (GPU ML) compose it via their `candy:` field. This prevents code duplication and ensures bug fixes propagate to all boxes.

## Usage philosophy and caveats

The MCP server **manages CRDT rooms invisibly**. Clients see notebooks and cells; the server takes care of room lifecycle. Reading or mutating any notebook just works — call `cell_get`, `cell_update`, `notebook_get` directly.

- **MCP works WITH the user.** Every `notebook_*` and `cell_*` tool auto-attaches to whichever CRDT room exists for the path (JupyterLab UI tab, another MCP session, or this one), or creates a fresh room if none exists. Calling `cell_update` on a notebook the user has open in JupyterLab edits THAT EXACT Y.Doc — the user sees changes in real time. **There is no scenario where MCP and UI work in parallel rooms.**
- **No client-side room management.** Clients do not open or close CRDT rooms. Idle rooms (no clients, no MCP activity for `MCP_ROOM_IDLE_TIMEOUT_SEC`, default 600s) are flushed and closed by a server-side sweeper. Configure the timeout via env var on the candy for fast tests.
- **`cell_update` is atomic by `cell_id`.** The cell's stable identifier is preserved across the update, so a sequence of `cell_update` calls never duplicates cells even when the room has concurrent state.
- **Path canonicalization.** Any path you pass — `"foo.ipynb"`, `"./foo.ipynb"`, `"/workspace/foo.ipynb"` — is normalized to the workspace-relative form before reaching `file_id_manager.index()`. All three converge on the same room. Host paths and `..` escapes are rejected with a clear error.
- **Single room per notebook is an INVARIANT.** Two MCP sessions plus the JupyterLab UI editing the same notebook ALL share one Y.Doc. If `room_list` ever shows two entries for the same logical file, that's a regression — open a bug.
- **Don't mix MCP cell-mutations with direct disk writes on the same notebook concurrently.** The upstream `jupyter_server_ydoc` file watcher CRDT-merges external writes against the in-memory state, producing hybrid cells. Pick one writer per session — either MCP or direct file edit, not both.
- **After bulk edits, `notebook_get` cell-count check is cheap insurance.** Defensive verification catches upstream regressions early.
- **`notebook_watch` returns on the FIRST change** after the call started. Pair with `notebook_get` if you need to confirm a specific change landed.
- **Idle rooms auto-flush + close.** A notebook with no connected clients and no MCP activity for `MCP_ROOM_IDLE_TIMEOUT_SEC` is flushed to disk and removed from memory. The next access auto-creates the room again from disk. No client-driven flush is needed.
- **`file_id_manager.db` is auto-cleaned on adapter init.** Rows whose path resolves outside the workspace (host-path leaks) and rows whose underlying file no longer exists (with no active room referencing them) are pruned. Idempotent and safe.

## How It Works

The `task:` performs three operations:

1. **Install FastMCP** — `pip install "fastmcp>=3.2.0"` (not via pixi because pixi's cross-platform resolver conflicts with opentelemetry-api on aarch64)
2. **Install jupyter-mcp extension** — `pip install --no-deps /ctx/jupyter_mcp` (from the candy's build context)
3. **Enable Jupyter Server extension** — writes `jupyter_mcp.json` to the Jupyter server config directory

## MCP Server

The extension registers a Streamable HTTP MCP server at `http://localhost:8888/mcp` (MCP spec 2025-11-25). It provides 11 tools, all named in `<noun>_<verb>` form.

| Category | Tools |
|----------|-------|
| Notebook management | `notebook_list`, `notebook_create`, `notebook_get`, `notebook_watch`, `notebook_list_users` |
| Cell operations | `cell_get`, `cell_update`, `cell_insert`, `cell_delete`, `cell_execute` |
| Read-only diagnostic | `room_list` |

| Tool | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `notebook_list` | List all notebooks in the workspace (filesystem) |
| `notebook_create` | Create a new empty notebook on disk (filesystem; the room auto-attaches on the first cell op) |
| `notebook_get` | Get full notebook content from the live CRDT document; auto-attaches to existing room or creates one |
| `notebook_watch` | Block until a CRDT change is observed; auto-attaches |
| `notebook_list_users` | List awareness users currently connected to one notebook's room (read-only diagnostic; returns `[]` if no room exists) |
| `cell_get` | Get a specific cell's content; auto-attaches |
| `cell_update` | Replace a cell's source IN PLACE — preserves the cell's `id`, leaves position in `_ycells` structurally untouched. Auto-attaches |
| `cell_insert` | Insert a new cell at a position; auto-attaches |
| `cell_delete` | Delete a cell; auto-attaches |
| `cell_execute` | Execute a cell, return outputs, AND write outputs + `execution_count` back via the in-place `set_cell` path. Auto-attaches |
| `room_list` | Read-only diagnostic: list every active CRDT room with rich metadata (`room_id`, `path`, `file_id`, `users`, `user_count`, `has_kernel`). Use to verify the single-room invariant |

### CRDT Collaboration

Cell operations mutate the live CRDT document — changes appear instantly in all connected JupyterLab clients. Multiple MCP clients and browser users can edit the same notebook simultaneously. The server uses `jupyter-server-ydoc` for CRDT document management. The single-room invariant means MCP and UI clients ALWAYS share one Y.Doc per logical file — calls converge through deterministic `room_id = json:notebook:<file_id_manager.index(canonical_path)>`.

**Key implementation details:**

1. **Auto-attach in `_resolve_notebook_doc`.** Every path-accepting adapter method routes through this single resolve point. It computes the canonical path, looks up the deterministic room_id, and either attaches to the existing `server.rooms[room_id]` (UI-created or MCP-created) or constructs a new room mirroring `YDocWebSocketHandler.prepare()`. Same code path → same room → no parallel state.

2. **In-place `set_cell`.** Cell mutations operate on the existing Y.Map's `source` (Y.Text), `metadata` (Y.Map), and `outputs` (Y.Array) IN PLACE. The cell's `id` and its position in `_ycells` are structurally untouched (no fresh UUID minted, no delete-then-insert at the CRDT level). A post-condition verify ensures `id` stability after every mutation.

3. **Path canonicalization at the boundary.** `_canonical_notebook_path(path)` resolves host paths and `..` escapes BEFORE any call to `file_id_manager.index()`. Prevents host-path leaks where an absolute host path could be minted into the container's file_id manager from a stray client call.

4. **Server-side idle-room sweeper.** A background asyncio task runs every `MCP_ROOM_SWEEP_INTERVAL_SEC` (default 60), flushes and closes rooms with zero connected clients and idle for > `MCP_ROOM_IDLE_TIMEOUT_SEC` (default 600). Activity tracking via `_room_last_active`: every CRDT mutation through the adapter bumps the timestamp, so an actively-mutated MCP-only room (no WS clients) is not reaped.

5. **`cell_execute` persists outputs.** After collecting iopub messages, the adapter translates them via `nbformat.v4.output_from_msg`, captures `execution_count` from the shell-channel `execute_reply` (works for `print()`/`display()`-only cells that don't emit `execute_result`), and writes `cell["outputs"]` + `cell["execution_count"]` back via `set_cell()` — the same in-place CRDT-aware path used by `cell_update`. Eventually flushed to disk by the upstream save_delay or the idle-room sweeper.

6. **`file_id_manager.db` cleanup on init.** A one-shot pass deletes rows whose path is outside the notebook root (host-path leaks) or whose underlying file no longer exists (with no active room referencing them). Idempotent — safe to run on every server start.

## Integration with mcp_provide

The parent `jupyter` candy declares `mcp_provide` to make this MCP server discoverable to other services at deploy time. The hermes service auto-discovers this server via the `CHARLY_MCP_SERVERS` env var and registers all 11 tools as `mcp_jupyter_<tool_name>`.

## MCP Name Decoupling (design principle)

The `jupyter` MCP server name is **deliberately decoupled** from the candy name, the Python package name, and the box name. Three places anchor it:

| File | Field | Value | Purpose |
|---|---|---|---|
| `candy/jupyter/charly.yml` | `env.MCP_SERVER_NAME` | `"jupyter"` | Runtime advertisement |
| `candy/jupyter/charly.yml` | `mcp_provide[0].name` | `jupyter` | Cross-container discovery (hermes, openwebui) |
| `plugins/charly-jupyter/.mcp.json` | `mcpServers.jupyter` | — | Claude Code static registration |

**Package/candy/box names describe the artifact; the MCP name describes the service contract.** Rename the artifact freely; the contract is stable.

## Used In Candies

- `/charly-jupyter:jupyter-ml` — GPU ML JupyterLab (`candy: [llama-cpp, unsloth, jupyter-mcp]`)

## Used In Boxes

- `/charly-jupyter:jupyter`
- `/charly-jupyter:jupyter-ml`

- `/charly-image:layer` — candy authoring rules (Tier 1 pattern)
- `/charly-build:charly-mcp-cmd` — client-side verb for probing this server's tool catalog (ping, list-tools, call); use `charly check live jupyter --filter mcp` to see all 11 tools this candy registers
- `/charly-selkies:chrome-devtools-mcp` — sibling MCP-server-provider candy for Chrome DevTools (different domain, same `mcp_provide` pattern)
- `/charly-hermes:hermes` — downstream MCP consumer (auto-discovers `jupyter` via `CHARLY_MCP_SERVERS`; uses the 11 tools to read/edit/execute notebook cells programmatically)
- `/charly-openwebui:openwebui` — downstream MCP consumer (sets `CODE_EXECUTION_ENGINE=jupyter` when this server is discovered, routing Open WebUI's in-chat code blocks to the Jupyter kernel)
